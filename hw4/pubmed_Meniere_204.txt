Is there progression of endolymphatic hydrops in Ménière's disease? Longitudinal magnetic resonance study.
Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) is universal in Ménière´s disease (MD). Given its chronic course, with variable interval before complete clinical picture is installed, it seems relevant to understand the progression of vestibular EH and hemato-perilymphatic barrier disruption in patients with MD and monosymptomatic presentations.
239 consecutive patients were referred to us with suspected hydropic ear disease. 50 individuals accepted to participate in this study-final longitudinal sample included 24 patients (7 D1, 7 D2, 10 D3). Control group included ten patients. At recruitment, a clinical and MRI re-evaluation was done (3T, intravenous technique) (MR2) and 2 years after MRI was repeated (MR3). Previous MRI (MRI1) were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were classified as definite (D1), possible (D2) and atypical (D3-monosymptomatic) MD. Control group included non-typical symptoms (C2/C3) and 6 asymptomatic (C1). Vestibular endolymphatic ratio (vER) and grading, presence/absence of cochlear EH, asymmetry of cochlear perilymphatic enhancement, and rate of progression of vER were assessed by two independent neuroradiologists and compared between patient and control groups (index ear).
EH was universal and pronounced in D1 and remained stable. vER progression was more variable and higher in some D3 patients (index ear worse) and in D2 (non-index), although this observation was not statistically significant.
Considering that many probable and monosymptomatic presentations progress years later into definite MD and given the bilateral tendency of the disease, these findings may indicate that there is an initial accelerated worsening of EH in initial stages of the disease. These data should be confirmed with controlled and larger sample studies.

Investigation of cochlear microphonics recorded with different stimulus types.
Electrocochleography (ECochG), one of the first defined tests under auditory evoked potentials, is a total electrical response of inner and outer hair cells inside the cochlea and auditory nerve record technique to the presence of an acoustic stimulus. These records can be used in Meniere disease and auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder diagnosis, intraoperative monitoring. In addition, the presence of cochlear microphonics plays a crucial role in auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder diagnosis. In our study, healthy individuals were tested with extratimpanic electrocochleography record method via Click and LS CE-Chirp stimulus, and the results were compared to the age, sex, and noise sensitivity categories.
This study had executed at Başkent University, Faculty of Health Sciences Audiology laboratory. The study group consisted of 42 volunteers between 18 and 40 years old. To understand the suitability of volunteers, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and transient otoacoustic emission tests were performed. Individuals with no hearing loss were tested with 100 dBnHL intensity level via click and LS CE-Chirp stimulus. The obtained values were statistically evaluated in the SPSS 23.0 program in accordance with the data distribution. An independent sample t-test was used for data showing normal distribution, and Mann-Whitney U test was used for data not showing normal distribution. The level (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant for all analyses performed.
Cochlear microphonic amplitudes recorded with click and LS CE-Chirp stimuli were higher in males than in females (p = 0.051 and p = 0.001, respectively). When the age groups were evaluated, no difference was observed in the CM amplitudes obtained with both click and LS CE-Chirp stimuli. There was no correlation between age and CM amplitudes. Additionally, it was determined that the CM amplitudes recorded with the click stimulus in individuals with noise sensitivity were higher than those without noise sensitivity (p = 0.051).
It is thought that the ECochG amplitudes of different gender, different age, and different noise sensitivity, which are the results of our study, can be used in the diagnosis of diseases such as auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder.

Worldwide Meniere's disease research: A bibliometric analysis of the published literature between 2002 and 2021.
In recent years, there has been an increasing number of publications on Meniere's disease. However, there are no bibliometric research on Meniere's disease. The purpose of this study was to find the focus and trends of Meniere's disease research through bibliometric approach.
Publications related to Meniere's disease in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) from 2002 to 2021 were collected. The bibliometric approach was used to estimate the searched data. Research foci of the studies were identified using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software.
A total of 1,987 articles meet the inclusion criteria and are included in the study. In the past 20 years, the number of Meniere's disease publications is gradually increasing, especially in the past 3 years. The country with the largest contribution to Meniere's disease research is the United States, followed by Europe and Japan. High-frequency keywords included Meniere's disease, endolymphaic hydrops, vertigo, meniere-disease, inner ear, dizziness, symptoms, hearing, diagnosis, and tentamicin. The analyses of keyword burst direction indicate that evoked myogenic potential, MRI, and committee are emerging research hotspots.
This study provides an objective, systematic, and comprehensive analysis of Meniere's disease-related literature. In addition, we find a dramatic increase in studies in this field over the past 3 years. Evoked myogenic potentials and MRI may become the research hotspots of Meniere's disease in future. This study will help otolaryngologists, neurologists, and audiologists to clarify the research direction and potential hotspots of Meniere's disease and further help clinicians improve patients' prognosis.

[Analysis on clinical application characteristics of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of Meniere's disease based on topology model by complex network].
To analyze the application characteristics of acupuncture and moxibustion in clinical treatment of Meniere's disease by using complex network technology, so as to provide evidence for selecting acupoints, needling and moxibustion methods and treatment ideas.
Articles both in English and Chinese published from the inception of databases of CNKI, Wanfang VIP, Chinese biomedical literature database (SinoMed), PubMed, Embase, EBSCO (Academic Search Pre-mier), Web of Science and Ovid to April of 2021 were retrieved by using key words "acupuncture" or "moxibustion" or "acupuncture and moxibustion" and "Meniere disease" or "Meniere's syndrome" or "Ménières vertigo" or "otogenic vertigo" or "auditory vertigo", followed by screening the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and establishing a database of clinical li-terature about acupuncture treatment of Meniere's Disease with software Epidata 3.1. Then, the descriptive analysis was conducted first, followed by association rule analysis using SPSS Modeler 18.0, and complex network analysis using Gephi 0.9.2 software.
A total of 232 articles were included, containing 152 acupoints [97 body acupoints as Baihui (GV20), Fengchi (GB20), Neiguan (PC6), etc., 28 otopoints as Ershenmen (MA-TF1), Shen (MA-SC), etc., 20 scalp points as Yunting Area, 7 extra-points as Sishencong (EX-HN1), Taiyang (EX-HN5), etc.] which were used to be a total frequency of 1 569. Descriptive analysis showed that the main meridians were the Governor Vessel, Stomach Meridian of Foot Yangming, Trienergizer Meridian of Hand Shaoyang, and Gallbladder Meridian of Foot Shaoyang. Acupuncture was the most commonly used therapy for Meniere's disease. The association analysis showed that the most relevant combination of acupoints was GV20 and GB20, GV20 and PC6, reflecting the principles of local acupoint selection and combination of local and distant acupoints. Finally, "K-core Analytic Hierarchy Process" and "Community Analysis" revealed that 3 core acupoint groups were most frequently used in clinical treatment of Meniere's disease, including 1) auricular acupoints, as MA-TF1, MA-SC, Neier(MA-L), Zhen(MA-AT) and Pizhixia(MA-AT1), 2) acupoints of the 14 meridians and extra-points, as Tinggong(SI19), Yifeng(TE17), GB20, 3) acupoints of the Shaoyang meri-dians of hand and foot, as Shuaigu (GB8), Tinghui (GB2), Zhongzhu (TE3), Ermen (TE21), etc.
The principle of acupoint selection is mainly based on the combination of acupoints along the meridians and local areas, while paying attention to the coordination among the auricular points, scalp acupoints and extra-points, which may provide a reference for the clinical treatment and scientific research on acupuncture treatment of Meniere's disease.

A potential serological biomarker for inner ear pathologies: OTOLIN-1.
The goal of the study was to determine whether the level of OTOLIN-1, a protein whose expression is highly restricted to the inner ear,is increased in the body fluids of patients with inner ear disorders in comparison to healthy subjects.
In the preliminary part of the study, OTOLIN-1 levels were measured in the serum, urine, and saliva of patients with an acute onset of Ménière´s disease and in healthy individuals. Subsequently, only serum OTOLIN-1 levels were taken into account and were compared between patients with acute onset of Ménière´s disease, sudden hearing loss, vestibular neuritis and healthy subjects.
The most reliable diagnostic parameter was OTOLIN-1 levels in serum. Serum samples of patients with Ménière's disease and sudden hearing loss showed significantly higher OTOLIN-1 levels than those from healthy individuals. In addition, there was no significant difference between the serum concentration of OTOLIN-1 in patients with vestibular neuritis and the control group.
Serum levels of OTOLIN-1 can potentially be used as a biomarker for acute onset of inner ear disorders due to its significant increase in patients with acute Meniere´s disease and sudden hearing loss in comparison to healthy individuals.

Transmyringeal ventilation tube insertion for unilateral Menière's disease: a protocol for a prospective, sham-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial.
Menière's disease is an idiopathic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo lasting more than 20 min, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus. If vertigo attacks occur frequently, the patient is usually severely incapacitated. Currently, there is no consensus on the treatment of Menière's disease. The evidence regarding most treatment options is sparse due to a lack of randomized trials together with an often-spontaneous relief over time and a considerable placebo effect. Insertion of a transmyringeal tube is a simple and relatively safe, minimally invasive procedure and previous open-label trials have shown promising results.
This is a prospective, sham-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial.
This trial aims to assess the effects of inserting a ventilation tube into the tympanic membrane compared with sham treatment for definite or probable unilateral Menière's disease according to the criteria formulated by the Classification Committee of the Bàràny Society.
The primary outcome will be the number of spontaneous vertigo attacks lasting more than 20 min and time to treatment failure. In addition to the primary outcome, we will assess various secondary outcomes related to hearing, ear fullness, dizziness, and serious adverse events.
An estimated 104 participants in total or 52 participants in each group will be necessary. The primary analysis will be according to the intention-to-treat principle. The trial will be initiated in 2021 and is expected to end in 2025.

Magnetic resonance imaging of endolymphatic hydrops in Ménière's disease: A comparison of the diagnostic value of multiple scoring methods.
To compare three methods of scoring endolymphatic hydrops in patients with Ménière's disease in order to assess the correlation between endolymphatic hydrops and auditory characteristics.
A retrospective study of 97 patients with unilateral definite Ménière's disease (DMD) who underwent contrast-enhanced three-dimensional fluid attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR) MRI. Each patient was scored by the Inner Ear Structural Assignment Method (IESAM), the Saccule to utricle area ratio (SURI), and the Four Stage Vestibular Hydrops Grading (FSVH), according to their corresponding axial images. Cohen's Kappa and intra-class correlation coefficient were used for consistency testing, combined with binary logistic regression analysis, to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the three methods. The degree of hydrops in different stages of MD was compared. The correlation between endolymphatic hydrops in the inner ear sub-units and hearing thresholds was further analyzed.
The intra- and inter-reader reliability for the scoring of endolymphatic hydrops were excellent. The IESAM had a high diagnostic value for identifying definite Ménière's disease (sensitivity: 86.6%, specificity: 97.9%). The hearing thresholds were correlated with the degree of endolymphatic hydrops. Stages 3 and 4 were more significant for the severity of hydrops than stage 1. Within the subgroups of the Ménière's disease patients, compared with the non-hydrops group and the pure vestibular hydrops (V group), the cochlear combined vestibular hydrops group (CV group) had significantly higher auditory thresholds. The amplitude ratio of electrocochleogram was significantly higher in the affected ear than in the healthy ear.
The IESAM is a more sensitive and specific diagnostic scoring method for the diagnosis of DMD. Diagnostic imaging may improve the detection of inner ear hydrops which is correlated with severity of hearing loss. A comprehensive evaluation of the inner ear sub-unit structures maybe necessary.

Pathological significance and classification of endolymphatic hydrops in otological disorders.
We summarize the presence of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in otological disorders evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of temporal bones, and propose a classification of EH based on its pathological significance. A search of the literature published in English-language journals was performed using electronic databases, especially focusing on EH-related otological disorders. Clinical articles that contained the terms EH and contrast-MRI published from 2007 to the present, with relevant human temporal bone studies, were included. The following three main points are discussed based on the results in the relevant articles: i) otological disorders that present EH, ii) current grading for evaluation of EH on MRI, and iii) a proposed classification of EH based on its pathological significance. MRI evaluation revealed that EH exists extensively not only in ears with typical Meniere's disease (MD), but also in those with various other otological disorders. The etiological classification of EH helps to summarize ideas for determining the pathophysiology of otological disorders, while a therapeutic classification provides clues to their management. MRI evaluations of EH have led to breakthroughs in investigations of EH in otological disorders. Precise grading for evaluation and clarification of EH on MRI based on its pathological significance could provide keys to elucidating the pathophysiology of EH-related otological disorders.

Assessment of the Cost Burden of Episodic Recurrent Vestibular Vertigo in the US.
Understanding of the economic burden of recurrent vestibular causes of vertigo and areas contributing to the cost is needed.
To analyze and identify the factors contributing to the direct medical costs associated with Ménière disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM), and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).
This economic evaluation used MarketScan Commercial Database claims data from 2018 to identify the non-Medicare patient population with the diagnoses of MD, VM, or BPPV. Data were analyzed January 1 to December 31, 2018.
The total direct medical costs associated with MD, VM, and BPPV.
A total of 53 210 patients (mean [SD] age, 47.8 [11.8] years; 67.6% female) were included in this study, with 34 738 normal comparisons. There were 5783 (10.9%) patients with MD, 3526 (6.6%) patients with VM, and 43 901 (82.5%) patients with BPPV in the data set. Mean age and sex were different across the different vestibular disorders. Across the different groups, patients with no comorbidities or with a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of zero ranged from 98.4% to 98.8%. Around 5% of patients were hospitalized with inpatient stay lasting between 4.6 and 5.2 days. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, there were large differences in mean adjusted annual payments/direct costs across the different groups (MD, $9579; VM, $11 371; and BPPV, $8247). This equated to a total incremental estimated cost of $60 billion compared with the normal population. The number of outpatient brain magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans per patient ranged anywhere from 1 to 20, while the number of inpatient brain magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans per patient ranged anywhere from 1 to 6. A heat map of the total cost expenditure indicated that the costs were concentrated around the Midwest, Lake Michigan, and the East Coast.
In this economic evaluation, the 3 most common causes of recurrent vertigo-MD, VM, and BPPV-had considerable medical costs associated with them. Extraneous imaging orders and vestibular testing are factors to consider for cost reduction. However, further research and widespread education is needed to optimize the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients presenting with vestibular disorders or dizziness.

Microstructural changes of the vestibulocochlear nerve in patients with Ménière's disease using diffusion tensor imaging.
To evaluate the microstructural changes of the vestibulocochlear nerve in patients with Ménière's disease.
A total of 26 subjects, 13 patients with MD and 13 healthy controls, underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on a 3T scanner. The independent sample 
t
-test was used to compare the differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between the two groups. A Pearson correlation was used between DTI and the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) scores.
There was a significant decrease in FA and an increase in ADC of the vestibulocochlear nerve in MD patients compared with healthy controls (
P
 = 0.04, 
P
 = 0.001). FA had negative correlations with the DHI score (
r
 = -0.62, 
P
 = 0.02) and DHI-functional score (
r
 = -0.64, 
P
 = 0.02).
These results are the first evidence of possible changes in the microstructure of the vestibulocochlear nerves in patients with MD. DTI is a potential technique for evaluating the vestibulocochlear nerve in patients with MD.

[Cross-cultural adaptation and clinical application of Meniere's disease outcomes questionnaire].
Objective:
To cross-culturally adapt the Meniere's Disease Outcomes Questionnaire（MDOQ） into Chinese language, to evaluate its reliability and validity, and to apply in clinical. 
Methods:
The MDOQ was translated according to the Brislin model. Cross-cultural adaption was done by expert discussion and pilot study. The MDOQ was applied to 101 patients to test its reliability and validity. The quality of life（QOL） of 272 patients was measured by MDOQ-C, analyzing the influence factors of QOL of patients with Meniere's disease. 
Results:
The CR value of each item of MDOQ-C exceeded 3.00, the Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.88, and the Spearman Brown coefficient was 0.90. The Pearson correlation coefficient of MDOQ-C and the DHI was 0.803（
P
<0.01）. Three factors were extracted by factor analysis, which could explain 60.503% of the total variance. The dimension composition was different from the original scale. The average QOL score of Meniere's disease patients was 52.94±13.87. The main influence factors were age, marital status, work status, with tinnitus and the number of vertigo attacks. 
Conclusion:
The MDOQ-C is reliable and valid. After dimension reconstruction, MDOQ-C can be used to evaluate the QOL of patients with Meniere's disease. Through the preliminary clinical application, the influence factors of quality of life of patients with Meniere's disease were identified, thus providing reference for optimizing clinical management strategies.

[The characteristics of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in unilateral Meniere's disease patients at different clinical stages].
Objective:
This study was to retrospectively analyze the results of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials（VEMP） in unilateral Meniere's disease（MD） patients. 
Methods:
The clinical assessment results of MD patients who visited the department between January 2016 to February 2022 were reviewed. Unilateral MD patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into three groups according to clinical stages, namely, group 1（stage Ⅰ+ stage Ⅱ）, group 2（stage Ⅲ） and group 3（stage Ⅳ）. The normal value data were used to investigate the incidence of abnormal P1 and N1 latencies, abnormal P1-N1 interwave latency, and abnormal interaural amplitude asymmetry ratio（IAR）. Afterwards, considering all the above mentioned parameters, the VEMP result of each patient was graded into four levels（grade 1 means VEMP result is normal, grade 2, 3 and 4 means the VEMP result is abnormal in different degrees）. The correlation between VEMP result level and pure tone average（PTA） of MD patients in different clinical stages was examined. 
Results:
The prevalence of cVEMP in three groups was 84.2%, 70.0% and 33.3%, respectively（
P
<0.05）. The prevalence of oVEMP in three groups was 63.2%, 34.0% and 16.7%, respectively（
P
<0.05）. The incidence of abnormal P1 latency, N1 letancy and P1-N1 interwave latency of cVEMP was 21.1%, 26.3% and 24.6%, respectively. The incidence of abnormal P1 latency, N1 latency and interwave latency of oVEMP was 15.6%, 43.8% and 3.1%, respectively. The incidence of abnormal cVEMP IAR in group 1, group 2 and group 3 was 6.7%, 21.2% and 33.3%, respectively（
P
>0.05）. The incidence of abnormal IAR of oVEMP in group 1, group 2 and group 3 was 16.7%, 23.1% and 0, respectively（
P
>0.05）. cVEMP and oVEMP result levels were significantly correlated with PTA（
r
=0.339, 
P
<0.01; 
r
=0.362, 
P
<0.01 ）, respectively. 
Conclusion:
With the progression of MD, the function of saccule-vestibular inferior nerve pathway and utricle-vestibular superior nerve pathway would deteriorate in the same way as hearing.

Is endolymphatic sac surgery an efficient treatment of Menière's disease patients? A systematic literature search and meta-analysis.
The purpose of this work is to assess the treatment efficiency of endolymphatic sac surgery in patients with Menière's disease.
This study provides a systematic literature review and meta-analysis based on the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. The main inclusion criteria of the literature review were the classification categories according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines of 1985 and 1995.
An effect of 9.25 dB postoperative weighted average hearing loss in surgically treated individuals is classified as "clinically not significant" according to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 85/95. In contrast, the deterioration by 26.23% in speech comprehension is considered as "clinically significant." An improvement of functional level scale assessment by two categories and vertigo control by assessment in category B can be observed.
The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that endolymphatic sac surgery may be beneficial as a treatment for Menière's disease in terms of a positive impact on functional level scale and vertigo control while yielding a negative impact on pure tone average hearing loss and on speech comprehension.

Bifenestral surgical and chemical labyrinthectomy, a new effective ablative surgical approach to intractable vertigo in Ménière disease elderly patients.
In this article, the bi-fenestral surgical chemical labyrinthectomy is introduced as a surgical demolition technique for treating resisting incurable forms of Meniere's disease in patients aged over 70 and/or with low hearing residues refractory to medical treatment.
The results on participants fitting the inclusion criteria (n = 16) were reported using anamnesis (frequency of the crisis), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Functional Level Scale (FLS) before and after the intervention.
Vertigo control was achieved in all patients of this case series. A difference of 57 and 3.67 in mean DHI (from 68 (SD 16.7) to 11 (SD 14)) and FLS (from 4.68 (SD 0.7) to 0.1 (SD 0.3)) scores respectively were seen after an average of 16.28 months. Contextually tinnitus was reported to improve in seven patients (43.75%), aggravate in three (18.75%) and remain unchanged in the remaining six (37.5%).
Bi-fenestral surgical chemical labyrinthectomy appears a safe, immediate, and effective demolition treatment for vertigo control in a restricted class of patients affected by intractable Meniere disease.

Factors associated with spontaneous nystagmus changes in acute Ménière's disease.
Neuro-otological factors that influence changes in spontaneous nystagmus (SN) during vertigo attacks in Ménière's disease (MD) remain unclear.
To identify neuro-otological factors that might influence the initial direction of SN and the directional change of SN.
A prospective, observational study of 22 patients with definite MD to evaluate the initial direction and directional change of SN during vertigo attacks, endolymphatic hydrops (EH) volume, and the function of horizontal semicircular canal and hearing levels.
SN consistently began as irritative in 17 of 22 cases, and 9 of 17 cases showed a definite change in direction after onset. SN consistently began as paralytic in 5 of 22 cases, and 3 of 5 cases showed a definite change in direction after onset. Subjects in the irritative initial SN group had less severe degrees of hearing loss, smaller cochlear and vestibular EH volume than the paralytic initial SN group (P = 0.017, < 0.001, and 0.009, respectively). Subjects in the SN direction change group had significantly smaller maximum slow phase velocity, percentage of caloric weakness and canal paresis than the no SN direction change group (P = 0.001, 0.006, and 0.001, respectively). Simple logistic regression analysis showed that smaller EH volume was significantly associated with initial irritative SN (OR = 0.867, 95% CI 0.762-0.988, P = 0.032) and that the degree of canal paresis was negatively associated with the presence of directional change of SN (OR = 0.022, 95% CI 0.002-0.289, P = 0.004).
The morphology of EH and canal paresis may independently affect the characteristics of SN in patients with MD.

Characteristics of clinical details and endolymphatic hydrops in unilateral and bilateral Ménière's disease in a single Asian group.
To elucidate the characteristics of the clinical details and endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in bilateral Ménière's disease (BMD).
A total of 545 patients with definite MD were enrolled. Demographic variables; the age of onset; disease course; inner ear function; the coexistence of related disorders such as migraine, delayed MD, drop attacks, and autoimmune diseases; familial history; and characteristics of EH were analyzed.
In the study population, the prevalence of BMD was 15.4%. The disease duration of BMD (84.0 ± 89.6 months) was significantly longer than that of unilateral MD (UMD, 60.1 ± 94.0 months) (
P
 = 0.001). As evaluated by hearing thresholds and cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, inner ear functions were more deteriorated in BMD (
P
 < 0.05) than in UMD. The proportions of delayed MD and a family history of vertigo were significantly larger in BMD (
P
 < 0.05). EH was observed in 100% of cases on the clinically affected side and 6.1% of cases on the unaffected side.
A low prevalence of BMD, longer disease duration, higher frequencies of delayed MD, and family history of vertigo in patients with BMD were significant findings observed in the present study. All affected ears presented with EH, and a low percentage of unaffected sides presented with EH.

Elevated G-CSF, IL8, and HGF in patients with definite Meniere's disease may indicate the role of NET formation in triggering autoimmunity and autoinflammation.
The etiology and mechanism causing Meniere's disease (MD) are not understood. The present study investigated the possible molecular mechanism of autoimmunity and autoinflammation associated with MD. Thirty-eight patients with definite MD and 39 normal volunteers were recruited, and 48 human cytokines/chemokines were quantified. In patients with MD pure tone audiograms, tympanograms and standard blood tests were performed. The mean hearing loss in the worse ear was 44.1 dB nHL. Compared to the referents, the concentrations of TNFα, IL1α, IL8, CTACK, MIP1α, MIP1β, G-CSF, and HGF in the sera of patients with MD were significantly elevated, while those of TRAIL and PDGFBB were significantly decreased. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) showed that G-CSF, MIP1α, and IL8 were above 0.8 and could be used to diagnose MD (p < 0.01), and the AUCs of CTACK and HGF were above 0.7 and acceptable to discriminate the MD group from the control group (p < 0.01). The revised AUCs (1 - AUC) of TRAIL and PDGFBB were above 0.7 and could also be used in the diagnosis of MD (p < 0.01). The linear regression showed significant correlations between MIP1α and GCSF, between IL2Rα and GCSF, between IL8 and HGF, between MIP1α and IL8, and between SCF and CTACK; there was a marginal linear association between IP10 and MIP1α. Linear regression also showed that there were significant age-related correlations of CTACK and MIG expression in the MD group (p < 0.01, ANOVA) but not in the control group. We hypothesize that G-CSF, IL8, and HGF, which are involved in the development of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and through various mechanisms influence the functions of macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, among others, are key players in the development of EH and MD and could be useful in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to MD. Biomarkers identified in the present study may suggest that both autoimmune and autoinflammatory mechanisms are involved in MD. In the future, it will be valuable to develop a cost-effective method to detect G-CSF, IL8, HGF, CTACK, MIP1α, TRAIL, and PDGFBB in the serum of patient that have diagnostic relevance.

A Spectrum of Intraoperative and Postoperative Complications of Cochlear Implants: A Critical Review.
A cochlear implant is a neuroprosthetic, electrical device that is developed for the treatment of patients who have sensory hearing loss. It directly stimulates the hearing nerve by bypassing the injured or damaged sensory receptors, the hair cells. This implant is directly placed in the inner ear. It is an electronic device which is proved to be very useful in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. This implant consists of a speech processor (externally present), which takes up the sound; transforms it into digital signals, and then internal components take it to convert it into electrical energy, which stimulates auditory nerves, and the brain perceives it and hears it as a sound. This is one of the most successful surgeries, which happens very frequently nowadays. Although, many complications are mostly associated with this implant. This paper deals with the preoperative, operative, and postoperative complications associated with cochlear implant surgery. That includes tinnitus, Meniere's disease, unilateral hearing loss, musical ear syndrome, infections; flap necrosis, facial nerve palsy, improper electrode placement, magnet displacement; failure and re-implantation, cholesteatoma, and pneumocephalus. These are just a few of the complications; there are much more complications which are associated with cochlear implants.

Prevalence of Ménière's Disease in Syrian Patients with hypothyroidism: Cross-sectional study.
Ménière's Disease, a long-term debilitating disorder has been increasingly found among patients with hypothyroidism. Our study aims to evaluate the prevalence of ménière's disease among hypothyroid patients and assess the interrelationship between patients' symptomology and ménière's disease.
A cross-sectional study was performed at the endocrinology clinics at Damascus Hospital and Syrian Red Crescent Hospital, Damascus, Syria between September 2021 and January 2022. Patients with hypothyroidism were interviewed using a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained questions about socio-demographic information, hypothyroid history, diagnostic criteria of ménière's disease, chief complaint, medical history, and lab test results. Patients, who reported ménière's disease symptoms, were referred to the otorhinolaryngology clinic for confirmation or exclusion of ménière's disease. At the clinic, patients underwent an otoscopy and a pure tone audiometry, probable and definite ménière's disease was diagnosed accordingly.
Of 217 hypothyroid patients included in the sample, 17 (7.8%) were diagnosed with definite ménière's disease and 31 (14.3%) were diagnosed with probable ménière's disease. Hypothyroid symptoms reported among patients diagnosed with definite ménière's disease compared to no diagnosis differed by feeling low (χ2 (1, 217) = 4.014, p = 0.045), and depressive appearance (χ2 (1, 217) = 8.887, p = 0.003). Patients diagnosed with definite ménière's disease, probable ménière's disease, and both definite and probable ménière's disease were more likely to report that their symptoms affected their lifestyle compared to those that reported no effect (χ2 (3, 217) = 62.565, p < 0.001), (χ2 (3, 217) = 31.380, p < 0.001), and (χ2 (3, 217) = 35.542, p < 0.001), respectively.
A high number of hypothyroid patients were diagnosed with MD. Clinicians should consider clinically screening for MD among hypothyroid patients presenting to clinics.

Potential nanotechnology-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for Meniere's disease.
Meniere's disease (MD) is a progressive inner ear disorder involving recurrent and prolonged episodes or attacks of vertigo with associated symptoms, resulting in a significantly reduced quality of life for sufferers. In most cases, MD starts in one ear; however, in one-third of patients, the disorder progresses to the other ear. Unfortunately, the etiology of the disease is unknown, making the development of effective treatments difficult. Nanomaterials, including nanoparticles (NPs) and nanocarriers, offer an array of novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications related to MD. NPs have specific features such as biocompatibility, biochemical stability, targetability, and enhanced visualization using imaging tools. This paper provides a comprehensive and critical review of recent advancements in nanotechnology-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for MD. Furthermore, the crucial challenges adversely affecting the use of nanoparticles to treat middle ear disorders are investigated. Finally, this paper provides recommendations and future directions for improving the performances of nanomaterials on theragnostic applications of MD.

The Diagnostic Value of 1.5T Versus 3.0T Magnetic Resonance Imaging Intratympanic Gadolinium Inner Ear Enhancement in Patients with Meniere's Disease.
A comparative study of 1.5T and 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging inner ear gadolinium enhancement was carried out to further explore the practicality and universality of 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of inner ear labyrinthine hydrops positive imaging.
This dual case-control study was conducted on 25 patients with Meniere's disease (experimental group), diagnosed by People's Hospital of Ordos Dongsheng District between April 2017 and April 2019 and 51 patients with Meniere's disease (control group), diagnosed by People's Hospital Affiliated to Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between March 2010 and February 2011 and published on Chinese Medical Journal in 2011. Both groups were injected with gadolinium diluent into bilateral tympanic chambers through the tympanic membrane, and 3 dimensional-Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the inner ear was performed 24 hours later. The results of the 2 groups were observed, calculated, and statistically processed.
The positive rate of membranous labyrinthine hydrops was 96% (24/25) in the experimental group and 96.1% (49/51) in the control group. The results are very close.
In clinical diagnoses of Meniere's disease, 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging and 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging have the same value and significance.

Vestibular syndromes after COVID-19 vaccination: A prospective cohort study.
Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms after COVID-19-vaccination. We aimed to prospectively evaluate objective central or peripheral vestibular function in patients with dizziness, vertigo, and postural symptoms that started or worsened after COVID-19-vaccination.
Of 4137 patients who presented between January 2021 and April 2022 at the German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, we identified 72 patients (mean age = 47 years) with enduring vestibular symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination. All underwent medical history-taking, and neurological and neuro-otological workup with bithermal caloric test, video head-impulse test, orthoptics, and audiometry. Diagnoses were based on international criteria. The distribution of diagnoses was compared to a cohort of 39,964 patients seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Symptom onset was within the first 4 weeks postvaccination. The most prevalent diagnoses were somatoform vestibular disorders (34.7%), vestibular migraine (19.4%), and overlap syndromes of both (18.1%). These disorders were significantly overrepresented compared to the prepandemic control cohort. Thirty-six percent of patients with somatoform complaints reported a positive history of depressive or anxiety disorders. Nine patients presented with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, three with acute unilateral vestibulopathy, and seven with different entities (vestibular paroxysmia, Ménière disease, polyneuropathy, ocular muscular paresis). Causally related central vestibular deficits were lacking. Novel peripheral vestibular deficits were found in four patients.
Newly induced persistent vestibular deficits following COVID-19 vaccination were rare. The predominant causes of prolonged vestibular complaints were somatoform vestibular disorders and vestibular migraine, possibly triggered or aggravated by stress-related circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccination. An increase of other central or peripheral vestibular syndromes after COVID-19 vaccination was not observed.

Vestibular syncope: clinical characteristics and mechanism.
Vestibular syncope is a condition in which vertigo-induced hemodynamic changes cause syncope. This study investigated the clinical and laboratory findings of vestibular syncope and tried to refine our knowledge of the mechanism underlying this newly recognized entity.
This study retrospectively analyzed 53 patients (33 women, median age = 63 years [interquartile range = 54-71 years]) with vestibular syncope from January 2017 to December 2021. To explain the mechanism of vestibular syncope, we incorporated a velocity-storage model into the dual reflex pathways comprising the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex and baroreflex and predicted the cardiovascular responses.
Twenty (37.7%) patients had multiple episodes of vestibular syncope, and seven (13.2%) had potentially life-threatening injuries. Meniere's disease (20.8%) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (9.4%) were the most common underlying vestibular disorders. Abnormal vestibular function tests included impaired cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (57.5%) and positive head impulse tests (31.0%). Orthostatic hypotension was found in 19.5% of patients. Dyslipidemia (30.2%) and hypertension (28.3%) were common medical comorbidities. The dual reflex pathways incorporating the function of the velocity-storage circuit in the brainstem and cerebellum suggest that vestibular syncope is a neurally mediated reflex syncope associated with a sudden hemodynamic change during vertigo. This change can be arterial hypertension triggered by a false downward inertial cue, as suggested previously, or hypotension driven by a false upward inertial cue.
Vestibular syncope is associated with various vestibular disorders and requires careful evaluation and intervention to prevent recurrent falls and significant injuries.

Cochlear implant outcomes in patients with Meniere's disease: a large case series.
To perform a matched cohort study to assess whether patients with Meniere's Disease (MD) require more intensive auditory rehabilitation following cochlear implantation (CI) and identify factors that may affect outcomes in patients with MD.
A retrospective case review was performed. MD and control patients were matched for age, biological sex, implant manufacturer and electrode design. Outcomes measured were speech scores, number of visits to audiology department following switch-on, and post-operative active MD.
Forty consecutive implanted MD patients were identified between May 1993 and May 2019. Patients with active MD following CI required significantly more visits to the audiology department compared to controls (P < 0.01) and patients who had inactive MD post-operatively (P < 0.01). However, in MD patients, active MD was less likely following CI (P = 0.03). In patients who continued to experience active MD post-operatively, further medical and surgical ablative intervention was required to control ongoing Meniere's attacks.
We present the largest case series of performance outcomes in CI patients with MD. Although speech outcomes in MD patients are comparable to controls, patients with active MD pre-operatively are more likely to experience variation in CI performance requiring a prolonged period of auditory rehabilitation compared to inactive preoperative MD.

[Characteristics of wideband tympanometry in patients with Ménière's disease based on neutral network].
Objective:
To construct a prediction model for Ménière's disease based on neural network and evaluate its prediction ability. 
Methods:
Sixty-four patients with Ménière's disease underwent gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of inner ear which showed endolymphatic hydrops. Meanwhile, 40 healthy adults were enrolled as controls. The database of wideband tympanometry of patients and control subjects was analyzed, and the neural network model was established by MATLAB 2021a software. The prediction ability of the model was evaluated by accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, the Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curve and area under curve （AUC）. 
Results:
A feedforward network model was built with a single hidden layer to predict Ménière's disease with wideband tympanometry. There were 104 features in the input layer, 13 neuron nodes in the hidden layer and 1 output neuron in the output layer. The accuracy of the model was 83.2%, the positive predictive value was 80.7%, the negative predictive value was 84.3%, the sensitivity was 76.5%, the specificity was 83.7%, the Youden index was 0.602, and the AUC was 0.855. 
Conclusion:
Based on neural network, the prediction model of Ménière's disease with high accuracy was constructed according to the results of wideband tympanometry, which provided reference for the diagnose of Ménière's disease.

[The effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in Ménière's disease patients with chronic imbalance].
Objective:
To observe the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in Ménière's disease patients with chronic imbalance. 
Methods:
Forty-five Ménière's disease patients with chronic imbalance treated in vertigo specialist clinic of Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University from December 2020 to December 2021 were enrolled. Patients were divided randomly into two groups, 23 patients in experimental group and 22 patients in control group. Both groups received routine outpatient treatment, and the experimental group received an additional vestibular rehabilitation for 8 weeks. All patients were evaluated with dizziness handicap inventory （DHI） at baseline and 8-week follow-up, and the incidence of fall was calculated. The occurrence of adverse events during the study was also recorded. 
Results:
There was no significant difference in baseline data between the two groups （
P
>0.05）. During the study, 1 patient were lost to follow-up and 2 patients dropped out. A total of 42 patients completed the study. Intentionality analysis was performed on lost follow-up patients. After 8 weeks of the treatment, there were significant statistically differences in difference values of DHI and DHI-F scores（
d₁
=-30.22±3.78, 
d₂
=-13.09±4.85, 
t

Comparison of Glycerol Test, ECochG and VEMP Findings in Patients with Meniere's Disease.
Present study aimed to find if multiple audio-vestibular tests can be used to improve in diagnosing Meniere's disease. The study compares the results of four test procedures of glycerol test, Electrocochleography (ECochG), cervical Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (c-VEMP) and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (o-VEMP) individually and also together to see whether the diagnosis of Meniere's disease can be improved. Experimental group consist of 16 participants (32 ears) diagnosed with Meniere's disease as per American Academy of Otolaryngology (AAO) -Head and Neck Foundation (2020) guidelines. Control group consist of 16 participants with compliant of only vertigo participated in the study. Participants in both group underwent glycerol test, Electrocochleography (ECochG), cervical Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (c-VEMP) and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential (o-VEMP). Glycerol test showed a 38% positive rate for the presence of Meniere's disease. ECochG indicated the presence of endolymphatic hydrops in 62% of the participants. Abnormal finding in c-VEMP and o-VEMP was seen in 31% and 56% of the participants respectively. The combination of two tests such as ECochG and o-VEMP has increased the positive rate upto 87%. Adding one more test of c-VEMP or combining all four audiovestibular tests had a positive rate of 94% only. The present study indicated ECochG is a more sensitive tool in the diagnosis of Meniere disease followed by o-VEMP. Thus, the present study indicated that combination ECochG and o-VEMP could be used to find the presence of Meniere's disease successfully.

Evolution of geriatric Meniere's disease during the past two decades.
This study compared the incidence of Meniere's disease (MD) in the elderly aged >65 years between the first (2001-2010) and second (2011-2020) decades to investigate the evolution of geriatric MD.
Totally, 1605 and 2550 patients with definite MD were experienced at the neurotological clinic during the first and the second decades, respectively. All patients were divided into three groups by 30-year age band, namely elderly (aged 65-94 years), adult (aged 35-64 years) and young (aged 5-34 years) groups, and underwent an inner ear test battery. Factors relating to the incidence of MD during the past two decades were analyzed.
The elderly MD group comprised 198 (12.4%) of 1605 MD cases during the first decade, and 463 (18.2%) of 2550 MD cases during the second decade, showing a significantly increased incidence of elderly MD. Correlation between annual life expectancy (x) in Taiwan and annual prevalence (y) of the elderly MD in relation to total MD cases revealed y = 0.023x - 1.660 via linear regression analysis. In contrast, the adult MD group significantly differed in terms of age and gender ratio, but not incidence, between the two decades. Conversely, the young MD group exhibited significantly decreased incidence from the first decade (22.3%) to the second decade (13.8%).
Evolution of geriatric MD during the past two decades reveals an increased incidence of the elderly MD patients, likely due to increased life expectancy coupled with altered life style.

Oral splint therapy in patients with Menière's disease and temporomandibular disorder: a long-term, controlled study.
To assess the effect of oral splint therapy on audio-vestibular symptoms in patients with Menière's disease (MD) and temporomandibular disorder (TMD).
Retrospective case-control study. Treatment group: 37 patients with MD and TMD who received gnatological treatment.
26 patients with MD and TMD who had never received gnatological treatment. The number of vertigo spells in 6 months (primary endpoint), pure-tone audiometry average (PTA), MD stage, functional level, Dizziness handicap Index (DHI), Tinnitus handicap Index (THI) and Aural Fullness Scale (AFS) were compared at baseline and after 24 months according to groups. Analysis of Covariance was used to determine the treatment effect.
Groups were comparable for demographic, clinical data, baseline PTAs and the number of vertigo spells. Analysis of covariance showed a significant effect of gnathological treatment on number of vertigo spells ([Formula: see text] = 0.258, p < 0.001), PTA ([Formula: see text] = 0.201, p < 0.001), MD stage ([Formula: see text] = 0.224, p < 0.001), functional level ([Formula: see text] = 0.424, p < 0.001), DHI ([Formula: see text] = 0.421, p < 0.001), THI ([Formula: see text] = 0.183, p < 0.001), but not for AFS ([Formula: see text] = 0.005, p = 0.582). The treatment group showed vertigo control of class A in 86.5% and class B in 13.5% of patients. In the control group, vertigo control was of class A in 19.2% of patients and class B in 11.5%, class C in 30.8%, class D in 11.5%, class E in 19.2% and class F in 7.7%. Classes of vertigo control differed significantly (X

 test, p < 0.001).
Oral splint therapy could represent a viable treatment in patients with TMD and uncontrolled MD disease. The effects are maintained at least after 2 years.

Predicting positive cochlear endolymphatic hydrops on magnetic resonance images.
This study correlated audiological results with magnetic resonance (MR) images to predict positive cochlear endolymphatic hydrops (EH) on MR images in patients with Meniere's disease (MD).
Retrospective study.
Twenty definite MD patients with positive cochlear EH on MR images were assigned to Group A. Another 20 definite MD patients with negative cochlear EH on MR images were assigned to Group B. All patients underwent an inner ear test battery followed by MR imaging using HRDROPS-Mi2 technique.
The mean hearing levels (MHLs) at frequencies of 125, 250, 500 and 1000 Hz revealed significantly worse in Group A than Group B. Significantly deteriorated MHLs were noted from Grades 0 to II at low frequency (125, 250, and 500 Hz), but not at mid-frequency and high frequency. The respective cutoff hearing thresholds at frequencies of 125, 250, and 500 Hz were 27.5, 32.5, and 40 dBHL, which help predict positive cochlear EH on MR images. By using the sum (27.5 + 32.5 + 40 = 100 dBHL) of cutoff thresholds from three low frequencies as a cutoff value, Group A (80%) showed significantly more ears with sum of low-frequency hearing threshold >100 dBHL than Group B (30%).
When sum of three low-frequency (125, 250, and 500 Hz) hearing levels is >100 dBHL, positive cochlear EH may be shown on MR images in definite MD patients. In contrast, those MD patients with sum of three low-frequency hearing levels <100 dBHL, MR imaging should be postponed because resolution of EH may cause negative MR images.

Comparison between 3D-FLAIR and 3D-real IR MRI sequences with visual classification method in the imaging of endolymphatic hydrops in Meniere's disease.
Clinically, the evidence of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in Meniere's disease (MD) primarily relies on audiological examinations, such as glycerol tests and electrocochleography, to suggest the presence of EH indirectly. However, these techniques lack sensitivity and specificity, and they do not sufficiently assess the degree of EH. This study aims to explore the application of three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) and three-dimensional real inversion recovery (3D-real IR) sequence imaging of EH in MD and to assess the image quality and grading of EH.
The study included 50 patients with definite MD. The 3D-FLAIR and 3D-real IR sequence images were performed 24 h after bilateral intratympanic injection of gadolinium. The image quality of both sequences was reviewed by two experienced radiologists. The vestibular and cochlear EH grades of both sequences were reviewed by two experienced otologists using a visual grading method. The Cohen's kappa and Pearson tests were used to analyze the data.
The reliability of image quality between the two radiologists was excellent (0.7 < kappa < 0.9). There were significant statistical differences in the image quality between the 3D-real IR and 3D-FLAIR sequences (p = 0.023 and p = 0.035, respectively). The reliability for the grading of vestibular and cochlear EH between the two otologists was excellent (0.7 < kappa < 0.9). The 3D-real IR sequence detected more severe hydrops than did the 3D-FLAIR sequence (p < 05).
The image quality of the 3D-real IR sequence is better than that of the 3D-FLAIR sequence, and there are differences in the vestibular and cochlear EH grades of both sequences. The sensitivity of the 3D-real IR sequence in the cochlea is higher. The method of visual grading can be applied to both technologies when combined with 3D-real IR.

Prevalence of anxiety and depression in Meniere's disease; a comparative analytical study.
Psychological problems are of most significant issues in patients with Meniere's disease (MD). This study aimed to reveal the frequency of anxiety and depression in MD patients compared to healthy individuals and patients with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV) referred to a university hospital.
This case-control study was conducted on individuals between 18 and 65 years old assigned to three groups: the control, MD, and BPPV groups. The data collecting instruments included a demographic information form, along with Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) questionnaires. Data were analyzed using SPSS software v.23, and the significance level was considered as p < 0.05.
A total of 177 participants enrolled. The average scores of anxiety and depression and the severity of anxiety and depression were higher in MD and BPPV groups than in the control group (P < 0.001). The average anxiety score and anxiety severity in the MD group was higher than in the BPPV group (P < 0.001). However, in the case of depression, only severity was higher in the MD group (P < 0.001), and the average depression score showed no significant difference between MD and BPPV groups. After controlling for underlying variables, the impacts of MD (P < 0.001; regression coefficient = 16.5) and also BPPV (P = 0.025; regression coefficient = 4.6) on anxiety were significant compared to the control group.
Our results suggest that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is higher in MD and BPPV patients than the healthy people, and MD has a higher effect on the incidence of depression and anxiety compared to BPPV.

Vestibular and audiometric results after endolymphatic mastoid shunt surgery in patients with Menière's disease.
Treatment of Menière's Disease (MD) comprises an array of both non-destructive and destructive treatment options. In patients who are therapy-refractory to non-destructive medical treatment, endolymphatic mastoid shunt surgery (EMSS) is both recommended and debated controversially. The aim of this study was to investigate safety in terms of hearing, vestibular function, complication rate, and efficacy with regards to vertigo control of EMSS in patients with MD according to the current diagnostic criteria of 2015.
Retrospective analysis of 47 consecutive patients with definite or probable MD with description of demographic parameters, pre- and postoperative MD treatment, pre- and postoperative audiometric (pure tone audiometry) and vestibular (caloric testing) results. The parameters were compared between patients with and without postoperative vertigo control.
31/47 patients (66.0%) had improved vertigo control postoperatively. Postoperative hearing and vestibular preservation were predominantly stable. No significant differences between patients with improved vertigo control and patients with no change or worse vertigo episodes were found. In the treatment refractory group, 4 patients required a revision EMSS and 6 a destructive MD treatment (5 gentamicin intratympanically, 1 labyrinthectomy). No peri- or postsurgical complications were reported.
EMSS was found to be beneficial in two thirds of the patients with definite or probable Morbus Menière and a safe procedure regarding hearing and vestibular preservation with no postoperative complications. Therefore, EMSS should be considered before inducing destructive treatment options, such as intratympanic gentamicin application or labyrinthectomy.

Correlation of clinical parameters with endolymphatic hydrops on MRI in Meniere's disease.
A clinical diagnosis of Ménière's disease (MD) is made based on medical history and audiometry findings. The 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guidelines requires histopathological confirmation of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) for a diagnosis of "certain" MD. Symptoms such as dizziness and ear fullness are important diagnostic features; however, the descriptions provided by patients are frequently vague and non-specific. A recently developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol to document EH is, therefore, useful for the evaluation of inner ear status in patients with MD. In this study, patients with MD were assessed using MRI and the HYDROPS (HYbriD of Reversed image Of Positive endolymph signal and native image of positive perilymph Signal) protocol to investigate the effectiveness of MRI for visualization of the endolymphatic space in the diagnosis of MD by correlating clinical laboratory parameters with the grade of EH. Of the 123 patients with MD recruited in this study, 80 had definite MD, 11 had probable MD, and 32 had possible MD based on the 1995 AAO-HNS guidelines. The EH grade based on HYDROPS MRI was determined independently by two otorhinolaryngologists and compared with several clinical parameters, including the diagnostic scale of MD (1995 AAO-HNS guidelines), pure tone average (PTA), low tone average (LTA), canal paresis (CP) on the caloric test, and disease duration. Cochlear hydrops and vestibular hydrops were detected in 58 and 80% of 80 definite MD ears, in 33 and 58% of 12 probable MD ears, and in 5 and 27% of 37 possible MD ears, respectively. The proportion of higher hydrops grades increased significantly with grade according to the MD diagnostic scale (
p
 < 0.0001). Both PTA and LTA were significantly higher in patients with hydrops grade 2 than hydrops grade 0 in both the cochlea and the vestibule. CP was significantly higher in patients with grade 2 than grade 0 vestibular hydrops. Disease duration was not associated with hydrops grade. Radiological evaluation of MD using the HYDROPS protocol is useful for evaluation of the extent and severity of EH in the diagnosis of MD based on its pathophysiological mechanism.

Transcriptional Down-Regulation of Major Histocompatibility Complex as a Possible Pathogenesis for Meniere's Disease.
This study aimed to determine the underlying pathogenesis of Meniere's disease (MD) using transcriptome analysis.
Total RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 39 patients with MD and 39 controls. Through microarray analysis for nine patients and controls, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of those two groups were screened based on cut-off criteria (|fold changes| > 2.0 and adjusted 
p
-value < 0.05). The functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO).
There were 996 DEGs identified in the MD group: 415 were upregulated and 581 were downregulated. A functional enrichment analysis indicated that the downregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in terms related to immune system processes. Among them, 17 genes were enriched in terms for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein complex, and the relative messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of three markedly downregulated DEGs [fold changes < -5: human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DMA, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DPB1] were significantly decreased in another 30 patients with MD compared with normal controls by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). However, there were no correlations between the expression levels of these three genes and clinical data, such as age, onset age, time course, or hearing threshold.
Our transcriptome analysis showed that the downregulated DEGs in MD were mainly associated with the immune system pathways including the MHC protein complex in MD. Remarkably, a breakdown in immunological tolerance mediated by MHC class II may contribute to the MD development, which has implications for targeted treatment.

Correlating atmospheric pressure and temperature with Meniere attack.
This paper correlated the Meniere attack with meteorological parameters i.e. atmospheric pressure, temperature, relative humidity and rainfall, to investigate which parameters that trigger the Meniere attack.
During the past three years, totally 283 (2015), 351 (2016) and 319 (2017) patients with Meniere's disease (MD) were encountered at a clinic of the university hospital, accounting for 13%, 17% and 16% incidence in relation to overall annual neurotological cases, respectively. The onset of Meniere attack was then correlated with meteorological parameters.
The mean seasonal incidence of Meniere attack in relation to overall seasonal neurotological cases in 2015-2017 were 14.8 ± 2.8% (spring), 17.5 ± 2.2% (summer), 16.0 ± 1.8 % (autumn) and 12.8 ± 2.0% (winter), indicating that summer season had a higher incidence of Meniere attacks than winter season. Onset of Meniere attacks correlated significantly with the atmospheric pressure (r = -0.4484, p = 0.0061) and temperature (r = 0.4736, p = 0.0035), and the atmospheric pressure was highly negatively correlated with the temperature (r = -0.9421, p < 0.0001). In contrast, no correlation was identified between the onset of Meniere attacks and relative humidity or rainfall. The atmospheric pressure in the same month with typhoon compared with that without typhoon revealed a median reduction of 13.1 hectopascal.
Atmospheric pressure and temperature are correlated with the onset of Meniere attack. Summer season has a higher incidence of Meniere attack than winter season, likely because low atmospheric pressure in summer may aggravate endolymphatic hydrops, especially when accompanied by typhoons in the northwest Pacific region.

Recovery of Unaided Hearing After Cochlear Implantation in Patient With Bilateral Menière's Disease.
To report a novel occurrence of unaided hearing recovery after cochlear implantation in a patient with Menière's disease.
A 49-year-old woman with bilateral Menière's disease and vestibular migraine.
Cochlear implantation.
Postoperative unaided and aided pure tone thresholds and speech recognition measures.
Six-month postoperative unaided hearing in the implanted ear was in the moderate sensorineural hearing loss range with a speech reception threshold of 45 dB and word recognition score of 95%, representing a significant improvement from preoperative hearing, which was in the profound sensorineural hearing loss range with an unaided speech awareness threshold of 75 dB and inability to perform speech recognition testing. Aided testing also demonstrated an expected postoperative improvement after 6 months with a CNC word and AzBio in quiet score of 96% and 93%, respectively, from 0% and 9% preoperatively.
Unaided hearing improvement after cochlear implantation in a patient with Menière's disease is unexpected, but possible and might lend insight into the poorly understood underlying mechanisms of sensorineural hearing loss in patients with Menière's disease.

Treatment of Meniere's disease by Multi-session Dexamethasone Injections.
Meniere's Disease (MD) is a complex and multifactorial inner ear problem characterized by episodic vertigo, unilateral sensori-neural hearing loss and tinnitus or fullness in the ear due to Endolymphatic hydrops. There are multiple treatment options available for this disease; from which cortisone therapy can be given in different routes and in different doses.
is to identify the successfulness of treatment of MD by multi-session intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection compared to the single-session method.
Interventional prospective study of study 70 cases of definite MD treated by 4 sessions of intra-tympanic injection weekly and compared to a control group of 66 cases of age matched patients with definite MD treated by the traditional single intra-tympanic injection. Patients In the study and the control group were observed for 6 months after the treatment for the development of any vertiginous attacks.
only 3 patients in the study group and 30 patients in the control group failed to respond to treatment and developed vertigo in the period of 6 months after treatment. The difference between the success rate in the two groups was statistically highly significant.
multi-session Intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection is superior to the single injection in control of vertigo in patients with definite MD.

Surgical Management of Intractable Meniere's Disease.
Meniere's Disease (MD) is an inner ear disorder characterized by spontaneous recurrent vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, aural fullness and low-pitch tinnitus. Therapeutic management of MD includes dietary restriction and medical therapy. A minority of cases is characterized by frequent vertigo attacks, progressive hearing loss and persistent tinnitus even through the continuous medical treatments; this condition is called intractable MD and requires a therapeutic escalation from non-invasive medical treatment to surgical intervention. Invasive procedures include endolymphatic sac surgery, vestibular nerve section and labyrinthectomy. These procedures have a very high success rate on symptom control but may have a severe impact on the hearing function. However, the simultaneous combined approach of demolitive surgery and cochlear implantation may be a valid approach to treat symptoms of intractable MD and preserve hearing function. In the present study, we review current literature focusing on intractable MD to describe and discuss advantages and disadvantages of established and newly proposed surgical treatments for intractable MD.

Dexamethasone does not affect endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in patients with Meniere's disease within 24 h, and intratympanic administration of gadolinium plus dexamethasone simplifies high-quality imaging of EH using a novel protocol of 7 min.
Intratympanic administration of gadolinium chelate allows for a better visualization of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) using MRI than intravenous injection and was recently further improved to facilitate high-quality imaging of EH in 7 min. The aim of the present study was to simplify the intratympanic administration protocol by mixing gadolinium chelate with therapeutic dexamethasone and to evaluate the effects of this mixture on the visualization of EH in MRI.
In an in vitro study, the potential impact of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) on the stability of dexamethasone was evaluated by analyzing dynamic changes in dexamethasone with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after mixing with Gd-DTPA. Ten patients with definite Meniere's disease (MD) were recruited to study the potential interference of dexamethasone on MRI visualization of EH, and 49 patients with MD were recruited to evaluate the effect of intratympanic injection of Gd-DTPA mixed with dexamethasone on MRI of EH using a 3T MR machine and a novel heavily T2-weighted 3-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery reconstructed using a magnitude plus zero-filled interpolation (hT
2
FLAIR-MZFI) sequence.
The retention times and peak area of dexamethasone in HPLC were not modified by the addition of Gd-DTPA. EH grading in the cochlea and vestibule was not influenced in any ear by intratympanic injection of dexamethasone. Excellent inner ear images were obtained from all patients, and EHs with various grades were displayed. There were significant correlations between diagnosis and cochlear EH (p < 0.01, Spearman's Rho), between diagnosis and vestibular EH (p < 0.01, Spearman's Rho), and between cochlear and vestibular EH (p < 0.01, Spearman's Rho). The distribution of Gd-DTPA plus dexamethasone negatively correlated with the grade of vestibular EH. Injury of the endolymph-perilymph barrier was detected in one cochlea and three vestibules of 59 inner ears with MD.
Intratympanic administration of Gd-DTPA plus dexamethasone yielded high-quality MRI images of EH in patients with MD using a novel 7-min protocol and simplified the clinical application. Intratympanic administration of Gd-DTPA plus dexamethasone might be used to test its therapeutic effect in future work.

MEFV, IRF8, ADA, PEPD, and NBAS gene variants and elevated serum cytokines in a patient with unilateral sporadic Meniere's disease and vascular congestion over the endolymphatic sac.
The etiology and underlying mechanism of Meniere's disease (MD) development are still unknown, although inflammation and autoimmunity have been implicated as underlying mechanisms. The human endolymphatic sac (ES) has been reported to have innate and adaptive immune capacity in local immune reactions. In vivo demonstration of inflammation of the ES in patients with MD is missing in the literature. We report the case of a 47-year-old female patient diagnosed with unilateral MD with genetic variants and cytokine markers indicating inflammation and vascular congestion of the ES. Endolymphatic hydrops in the right cochlea (grade 2) and vestibulum (grade 3) were detected using MRI. She carried heterozygous variants in MEFV (c.442G > C), IRF8 (c.1157G > T), ADA (c.445C > T), PEPD (c.151G > A), NBAS (c.4049T > C), CSF2RB (c.2222C > T), HPS6 (c.277G > T), IL2RB (c.1109C > T), IL12RB1 (c.1384G > T), IL17RC (c.260_271del GCAAGAGC TGGG), LIG1 (c.746G > A), RAG1 (c.650C > A), and SLX4 (c.1258G > C, c.5072A > G). In the serum, the levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and IL7 were significantly elevated, and the level of IL2Rα was reduced. Intratympanic administration of dexamethasone temporarily alleviated her hearing loss. Her vertigo was significantly relieved but remained slight after ES administration of corticosteroids.

Correlation of semi-quantitative findings of endolymphatic hydrops in MRI with the audiometric findings in patients with Meniere's disease.
Purpose:
 To investigate the correlation between vestibular hydrops (VH), cochlearhydrops (CH), vestibular aqueduct non-visibility (VANV), and visually increased perilymphatic enhancement (VIPE) with the findings of pure-tone audiometry (PTA) in Meniere's disease (MD) patients. 
Methods:
 In this cross-sectional study, 53 ears belonging to 48 patients were divided into two groups and evaluated. In group "MD patients," there were 24 ears of 19 patients diagnosed with the definite MD (14 patients with unilateral and 5 patients withbilateral involvements). The "control group" consisted of 29 non-symptomatic ears belonging to patients diagnosed with unilateral sudden sensory-neural hearing loss or unilateral schwannoma. All the patients underwent 2 sessions of temporal bone MRI using the same 3T system: an unenhanced axial T1, T2, and 3D-FLAIR MRI, an intravenous gadolinium-enhanced axial T1 fat-sat, and 4 h after the injection, an axial 3D-T2 cube and 3D-FLAIR session. VH, CH, VANV, and VIPE were assessed. Subsequently, the correlation between EH indices and PTA findings (in three frequency domains of low, middle, and high) were evaluated, and the predictive value of MRI was calculated. 
Results:
 VH was significantly correlated with the hearing threshold in the low, middle, and high-frequency domains. CH was also correlated with the hearing threshold in the low and middle domains. Contrarily, VIPE was not associated with hearing thresholds, and VANV was only correlated with the hearing threshold in low frequencies. 
Conclusion:
 The grade of VH, CH, and VANV were significantly correlated with the hearing thresholds in PTA.

[Consensus on intratympanic drug delivery for Menière's disease].
Objective:
Intratympanic（IT） drug delivery receives attention due to its effectivity in treatment for Menière's disease（MD）. Due to the release of the consensuses and new evidence on IT drug delivery for MD have been published, the review with a view to supplementing the details of IT treatment of MD is indispensable. 
Methods:
The literatures on IT injection for MD treatment over the last two decades are retrieved, International consensus（ICON） on treatment of Menière's disease（2018）, Clinical Practice Guideline（2020） and European Position statement on Diagnosis and Treatment of Menière's disease（2018） are taken into account for reference, and follow advice from experts from Europe, USA and China. 
Results:
Experts agree on the following: ①The effectiveness of IT methylprednisolone（ITM） on vertigo control seems to be somewhat better than that of IT dexamethasone（ITD）, and ITM can restore hearing in some cases. ②Due to the ototoxicity of aminoglycosides, the application of intratympanic gentamicin（ITG） in MD patients with good hearing is conservative. However, some studies suggest that ITG with low doses has no significant effect on hearing, which needs to be further proved by clinical studies with high levels of evidence. ③Currently, generally accepted treatment endpoint of ITG is no vertigo attack in a 12-month period or a vestibular loss in objective tests in the affected ear. 
Conclusion:
More studies with high level of evidence are needed to evaluate the drug type, efficacy, and therapeutic endpoint of IT therapy for MD.

Insights into Inner Ear Function and Disease Through Novel Visualization of the Ductus Reuniens, a Seminal Communication Between Hearing and Balance Mechanisms.
The sensory end-organs responsible for hearing and balance in the mammalian inner ear are connected via a small membranous duct known as the ductus reuniens (also known as the reuniting duct (DR)). The DR serves as a vital nexus linking the hearing and balance systems by providing the only endolymphatic connection between the cochlea and vestibular labyrinth. Recent studies have hypothesized new roles of the DR in inner ear function and disease, but a lack of knowledge regarding its 3D morphology and spatial configuration precludes testing of such hypotheses. We reconstructed the 3D morphology of the DR and surrounding anatomy using osmium tetroxide micro-computed tomography and digital visualizations of three human inner ear specimens. This provides a detailed, quantitative description of the DR's morphology, spatial relationships to surrounding structures, and an estimation of its orientation relative to head position. Univariate measurements of the DR, inner ear, and cranial planes were taken using the software packages 3D Slicer and Zbrush. The DR forms a narrow, curved, flattened tube varying in lumen size, shape, and wall thickness, with its middle third being the narrowest. The DR runs in a shallow bony sulcus superior to the osseus spiral lamina and adjacent to a ridge of bone that we term the "crista reuniens" oriented posteromedially within the cranium. The DR's morphology and structural configuration relative to surrounding anatomy has important implications for understanding aspects of inner ear function and disease, particularly after surgical alteration of the labyrinth and potential causative factors for Ménière's disease.

Risk factors for Meniere disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
To summarized the latest evidence of risk factors for developing MD.
We searched Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, CBM, VIP, WanFANG, and CNKI, and ClinicalTrials.gov. till June 2021 for cohort and case-control studies investigating risk factors for MD. The exposure group was participants with a clinical diagnosis of MD which was made according to the diagnostic scale of the Equilibrium Committee of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), the control group was participants without MD. The outcome was determined by incidence or prognostic of MD. Paired reviewers independently screened citations, assessed bias risk of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios(HR), relative risk(RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data. The statistical analyses were carried out with the use of Review Manager 5.3. The level of statistical heterogeneity for pooled data were assessed by using I

 statistics and Q-test.
768 abstracts and articles were identified by our search, of which 25 studies (n = 1, 471, 944) were included. There were 18 cohort studies, 7 case-control studies. Three distinct subgroups (age, sex, sleep) were identified. There were a total of two studies involving age, two studies involving gender and two studies involving sleep disorder. High to moderate methodological quality established that age [hazard ratios (HR) 2.21, 95% CI 1.85-2.65, I

 = 0%] and sleep disorder[HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.47-1.93, I

 = 74%].
The current evidence supports the suggestion that age and sleep disorder are risk factors for MD. Sex, gene, and hypothyroidism are tentative risk factors but conflicting/inconclusive results.

Magnetic Targeting of Gadolinium Contrast to Enhance MRI of the Inner Ear in Endolymphatic Hydrops.
1. Determine the feasibility and efficiency of local magnetic targeting delivery of gadolinium (Gad) contrast to the inner ear in rodents. 2. Assess any potential ototoxicity of magnetic targeting delivery of Gad in the inner ear. 3. Study the utility of magnetic targeting delivery of Gad to visualize and quantify endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in a transgenic mouse model.
Controlled in vivo animal model study.
Paramagnetic Gad was locally delivered to the inner ear using the magnetic targeting technique in both rat and mouse models. Efficiency of contrast delivery was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ototoxicity of Gad was examined with histology of the cochlea and functional audiological tests. The Phex mouse model was used to study EH, hearing loss, and balance dysfunction. Magnetic targeting delivery of Gad contrast was used in the Phex mouse model to visualize the effects of EH using MRI.
Magnetic targeting improved the delivery of Gad to the inner ear and the technique was reproducible in both rat and mouse models. The delivery method did not result in microstructural damage or any significant hearing loss in a normal animal. Magnetic targeting of Gad in the Phex mouse model allowed detailed visualization and quantification of EH.
This study provided the first evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of the local magnetic targeting delivery of gadolinium contrast to the inner ear and its application to the visualization and quantification of EH. Laryngoscope, 2022.

Optimized 3D-FLAIR sequences to shorten the delay between intravenous administration of gadolinium and MRI acquisition in patients with Menière's disease.
The aim of this study was to shorten the 4-h delay between the intravenous administration of gadolinium and MRI acquisition for hydrops evaluation using an optimized 3D-FLAIR sequence in patients with Menière's disease.
This was a single-center prospective study including 29 patients (58 ears), recruited between November 2020 and February 2021. All patients underwent a 3-T MRI with an optimized 3D-FLAIR sequence without contrast then at 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after intravenous administration of gadobutrol. The signal intensity ratio was quantitatively assessed with the region of interest method. We also evaluated the volume of endolymphatic structures (saccule, utricle) then the presence of endolymphatic hydrops and blood-labyrinthine barrier impairment at each acquisition time.
For all ears, the signal intensity ratio was significantly non-inferior at 2 h compared to 4 h, with a mean geometric signal intensity ratio at 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76 to 0.90, one-sided p < .001 for non-inferiority at -30% margin). Mean volume equivalence of saccule and utricle between 2 and 4 h was proven at a ± 0.20 standardized deviation equivalence margin. Intra-rater agreements (Cohen's kappa) were all greater than 0.90 for all endolymphatic hydrops location and blood-labyrinthine-barrier impairment between the 2- and 4-h assessments.
We demonstrated that using an optimized 3D-FLAIR sequence we could shorten the acquisition from 4 to 2 h with a high reliability for the diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops and blood-labyrinthine-barrier impairment.
Clinical trial no: 38RC15.173 KEY POINTS: • Magnetic resonance imaging with delayed 3D-FLAIR sequences allows the diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops in patients with definite Menière's disease. • An optimized 3D-FLAIR sequence with a long TR of 16000 ms and a constant flip angle allows for reducing the delay between intravenous injection of gadobutrol and MRI acquisition from 4 to 2 h to diagnose endolymphatic hydrops. • Reducing this delay between intravenous injection and MRI acquisition could have implications for clinical practice for both patients and imaging departments.

New Genetic Variants in 
The objective was to study the genetic etiology of Ménière's disease (MD) using next-generation sequencing in three families with three cases of MD. Whole exome sequencing was used to identify rare genetic variants co-segregating with MD in Finnish families. In silico estimations and population databases were used to estimate the frequency and pathogenicity of the variants. Variants were validated and genotyped from additional family members using capillary sequencing. A geneMANIA analysis was conducted to investigate the functional pathways and protein interactions of candidate genes. Seven rare variants were identified to co-segregate with MD in the three families: one variant in the 
CYP2B6
 gene in family I, one variant in 
GUSB
 and 
EPB42
 in family II, and one variant in each of the 
SLC6A
, 
ASPM
, 
KNTC1
, and 
OVCH1
 genes in family III. Four of these genes were linked to the same co-expression network with previous familial MD candidate genes. Dysfunction of 
CYP2B6
 and 
SLC6A
 could predispose to MD via the oxidative stress pathway. Identification of 
ASPM
 and 
KNTC1
 as candidate genes for MD suggests dysregulation of mitotic spindle formation in familial MD. The genetic etiology of familial MD is heterogenic. Our findings suggest a role for genes acting on oxidative stress and mitotic spindle formation in MD but also highlight the genetic complexity of MD.

Predicting neural deficits in sensorineural hearing loss from word recognition scores.
The current gold standard of clinical hearing assessment includes a pure-tone audiogram combined with a word recognition task. This retrospective study tests the hypothesis that deficits in word recognition that cannot be explained by loss in audibility or cognition may reflect underlying cochlear nerve degeneration (CND). We collected the audiological data of nearly 96,000 ears from patients with normal hearing, conductive hearing loss (CHL) and a variety of sensorineural etiologies including (1) age-related hearing loss (ARHL); (2) neuropathy related to vestibular schwannoma or neurofibromatosis of type 2; (3) Ménière's disease; (4) sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), (5) exposure to ototoxic drugs (carboplatin and/or cisplatin, vancomycin or gentamicin) or (6) noise damage including those with a 4-kHz "noise notch" or reporting occupational or recreational noise exposure. Word recognition was scored using CID W-22 monosyllabic word lists. The Articulation Index was used to predict the speech intelligibility curve using a transfer function for CID W-22. The level at which maximal intelligibility was predicted was used as presentation level (70 dB HL minimum). Word scores decreased dramatically with age and thresholds in all groups with SNHL etiologies, but relatively little in the conductive hearing loss group. Discrepancies between measured and predicted word scores were largest in patients with neuropathy, Ménière's disease and SSNHL, intermediate in the noise-damage and ototoxic drug groups, and smallest in the ARHL group. In the CHL group, the measured and predicted word scores were very similar. Since word-score predictions assume that audiometric losses can be compensated by increasing stimulus level, their accuracy in predicting word score for CHL patients is unsurprising. The lack of a strong age effect on word scores in CHL shows that cognitive decline is not a major factor in this test. Amongst the possible contributions to word score discrepancies, CND is a prime candidate: it should worsen intelligibility without affecting thresholds and has been documented in human temporal bones with SNHL. Comparing the audiological trends observed here with the existing histopathological literature supports the notion that word score discrepancies may be a useful CND metric.

Quality of life after intratympanic steroid injection for Ménière's disease.
This study explores how treatment with intratympanic steroid injection affects quality of life, as well as several subjective complaints in patients with Ménière's disease.
Patients filled in the Ménière's Disease Outcome Questionnaire (MDOQ) and answered questions about subjective complaints. Scores before and after treatment were compared using paired 
t
 tests.
Forty-nine patients treated with intratympanic steroid injection were included. Quality of life was improved in 36 (73%) patients, the same in 9 (18%) patients, and lower in 4 (8%) patients. Overall, the mean change in MDOQ was +20.6 points (95% confidence interval +14.5 to +26.7 points, 
p
 < 0.001). The improvement was seen in the emotional, physical, and mental domain. Most patients experienced less vertigo and instability but did not notice change in subjective hearing, tinnitus, or aural fullness after treatment.
Treatment with intratympanic steroid injection leads to an improvement in quality of life in most patients. Moreover, the procedure is only minimally invasive. Based on the findings in this study, treatment with ITS should be discussed with every patient suffering from vertigo attacks due to active Ménière's disease.

Dizziness in the Emergency Department: Insights and Epidemiological Data - a Population Based Study.
Background:
Dizziness is a commonly referred symptom in emergency departments (EDs). The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of dizziness included acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) in the ED of the University Hospital of Ioannina, Grecce, during a six-month period. 
Methods:
A total of 60 patients presenting with dizziness to the ED of our hospital during a short period of six months in 2021 were identified. Data were obtained through retrospective and prospective review of medical records. Statistical analysis was based on ÉBM-SPSS Statistics 26.0. 
Results:
Among the 60 patients, 16.67% received the diagnosis of cerebellar stroke, 3.33% Meniere disease, 16.67% vestibular neuritis, 20% benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 3.33% cardiovascular disease, and 1.67% had a neurological disease. Finally, 35% of patients left the ED undiagnosed. 
Conclusion:
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was found to be the most common cause of dizziness in the ED, followed by cerebellar stroke and vestibular neuritis. A detailed neurological examination is recommended for the diagnosis of dizziness in the ED. Our data confirm the findings of previous studies in the GreeK population of patients presenting with dizziness to the ED of our hospital.

Characterization of Thyroid Hormones Antivertigo Effects in a Rat Model of Excitotoxically-Induced Vestibulopathy.
Impaired vestibular function induces disabling symptoms such as postural imbalance, impaired locomotion, vestibulo-ocular reflex alteration, impaired cognitive functions such as spatial disorientation, and vegetative deficits. These symptoms show up in sudden attacks in patients with Ménière or neuritis and may lead to emergency hospitalizations. To date, however, there is no curative solution to these pathologies and the effectiveness of treatments used to reduce symptoms in the management of patients is discussed. Thus, elucidating the biological mechanisms correlated to the expression kinetics of the vestibular syndrome is useful for the development of potential therapeutic candidates with a view to relieving patients and limiting emergency hospitalizations. Recently, a robust antivertigo effect of thyroxine (T4) was demonstrated in a rodent model of impaired vestibular function induced by unilateral surgical section of the vestibular nerve. The aim of the present study was to assess thyroid hormones L-T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) as well as the bioactive thyroid hormone metabolite TRIAC on a rodent model of acute unilateral vestibulopathy more representative of clinical vestibular pathology. To this end, a partial and transient unilateral suppression of peripheral vestibular inputs was induced by an excitotoxic lesion caused by transtympanic injection of kainic acid (TTK) into the inner ear of adult rats. Vestibular syndrome and functional recovery were studied by semi-quantitative and quantitative assessments of relevant posturo-locomotor parameters. In contrast to the effect previously demonstrated in the complete and irreversible vestibular injury model, administration of thyroxine in the TTK rodent model did not display significant antivertigo effect. However, it is noteworthy that administration of thyroxine showed trends to prevent posturo-locomotor alterations. Furthermore, the results of the current study suggested that a single dose of thyroxine is sufficient to induce the same effects on vestibular syndrome observed with sub-chronic administration, and that reducing the T4 dose may more efficiently prevent the appearance of vestibular deficits induced by the excitotoxic type lesion. Finally, comparison of the antivertigo effect of T4 in different vestibulopathy models enables us to determine the therapeutic indication in which thyroxine could be a potential therapeutic candidate.

Endolymphatic hydrops presumption tests for patients with vestibular migraine.
The aetiology of vestibular migraine (VM) has not yet been defined; endolymphatic hydrops (EH) has been suggested as a candidate.
This study aimed to clarify the relationship between VM and EH using neuro-otological tests, including the EH presumption test.
Fourteen patients with VM underwent caloric testing, video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP and oVEMP), and EH presumption tests such as the Futaki's test and furosemide loading VEMP.
Caloric testing was abnormal in two of the 14 cases (14.3%), and vHIT was abnormal in one of 12 cases (8.3%). Abnormal asymmetry ratios (ARs) of cVEMP and oVEMP were observed in two of 14 cases (14.3%) and six of 13 cases (46.2%), respectively. Futaki's test results were positive in five of 14 cases (35.7%). Furosemide loading VEMP was positive in seven of 14 cases (50.0%). Nine patients (64.3%) were positive for at least one EH presumption test.
EH is not a rare finding in VM; however, the ratio is less than that in Meniere's disease.

[New discovery and short-term effect analysis of tensor tympani muscle tenotomy for Meniere's disease under otoscope].
Objective:
 To explore the feasibility and short-term effect of tensor tympani muscle Tenotomy in the treatment of Meniere's disease under otoscope. The possible pathogenesis was discussed and our views were put forward. 
Methods:
 The clinical data of 9 cases of Meniere's disease treated by otoscopic Tenotomy were analyzed retrospectively, including 2 males, 7 females, 5 right ones, 2 left ones and 2 bilateral ones. The average age was (56.33± 10.56) years, ranging from 38 to 75 years. We evaluated intraoperative findings and short-term postoperative efficacy, respectively evaluated postoperative aural fullness, tinnitus and hearing recovery, and evaluated postoperative vertigo attack in a short time. 
Results:
 Nine patients were completed the operation under general anaesthesia and otoscopy, and no serious complications occurred. We found new pathological changes in tympanic cavity in some cases during operation. There were rupture of round window membrane in 1 case, severe fibrous hyperplasia near the round window membrane and vestibular window and adhesion with ossicular chain in 1 case, fibrous cord and membranous hyperplasia near vestibular window and round window membrane in 1 case, fibrous hyperplasia and adhesion near the round window membrane in 2 cases, membranous hyperplasia and adhesion around vestibular window in 1 case. No fibrous hyperplasia was found in 3 cases in the tympanic cavity. The round window membrane can be exposed in 4 cases and failed in 5 cases. After 3 months of follow-up, we found that we found that 5/5 cases of aural fullness disappeared, 2/2 cases of earache disappeared, 3/8 cases of tinnitus improved, 5/8 cases presented with improvement and no aggravation, 3/3 cases of hearing allergy improved, 4/9 cases of hearing improved, and 5/9 cases showed no improvement or decrease. 9 patients were followed up for 3 months, of whom 8 patients had no vertigo, one patient suffered from vertigo twice within 3 months after operation, and the patient suffered from rupture of round window membrane. 
Conclusions:
 Endoscopic Tenotomy for Meniere's disease has obvious curative effect and quick recovery after operation. During the operation, we find that most of Meniere's patients have fibrous cord hyperplasia near the inner ear window membrane, which may be the pathological manifestation after repeated rupture and repair of the inner ear window membrane. The vertigo of Meniere's disease may be related to the destruction and repair of inner ear membrane structure caused by improper contraction or spasm of tympanic tensor muscle.

Is Inadequate Water Intake a Risk Factor for Vestibular Disorders?
Water is a vital nutrient for the human body system and failing to consume enough water could cause health problems. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between water intake and vestibular system disorders.
Data from 93 patients (aged between 20 and 76 years) with vestibular disorders were analyzed in the study. The mean age of the patients was 46.96 ±13.94 years (female: 45.68 ±13.45, male: 49.96 ±14.85), and 69.9% (n=65) were female. Participants were sub-categorized into diagnostic groups as follows: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness. The water intake information was analyzed for total water, plain water, and caffeinated beverages separately and compared between groups.
There was a significant difference between vestibular neuritis and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (P < .001) and also between vestibular neuritis and Meniere's disease (P = .021) in terms of the intake values of plain water and total water. No significant difference was found between groups in caffeinated beverages intake (P = .151), and it was found that there is no statistically significant difference in plain water and total water intake in terms of gender (P > .05).
The most significant result of this study is that inadequate water intake can be a risk factor for some forms of peripheral vestibular disorders. People should be informed about the importance of drinking water and be encouraged to increase their water intake.

Population-based study for the comorbidities and associated factors in Ménière's disease.
To date, no study has reported the objective metabolic laboratory findings worldwide or the comorbidities for Ménière's disease (MD) using a population-based design in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the comorbidities and associated factors for MD using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. This retrospective population-based study was conducted using a data from the National Sample Cohort database from 2009 to 2015. We only enrolled patients whose records showed a prescription for MD medicine and audiometry findings as well as an appropriate diagnostic code. We also included a matched cohort without MD who were enrolled randomly and matched for sex, age, year of diagnosis, income level, and residential area with the MD group with a ratio of 10:1. We evaluated comorbidities including autoimmune, allergic, metabolic diseases and cancer and the health screening data including general characteristics (height, weight, waist circumference, body mass index, and blood pressure), laboratory findings (fasting glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoproteintryglyceride (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoproteintryglyceride cholesterol, hemoglobin, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltrans- peptidase (rGT)), and general health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, and exercise) of the MD group, and compared these characteristics with those of the MD-free control group. A total of 2,013 and 20,130 participants were included in the MD and MD-free control groups (1,640 and 15,458 for health screening data). We found the increase in incidence of allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma, decrease in systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and rGT, and less frequent alcohol consumption and less prevalent smoking in the MD group. No significant differences were observed between the groups in the incidence of autoimmune diseases, and cerebro- and cardiovascular disease as well as health screening data and objective laboratory findings. Inconsistence with published studies, the results of this study suggest that the autoimmunity and metabolic disorder, and skeletal growth might not be associated with the onset of MD. Another well-designed study for other races will be needed to the generalization of this study results.

Low Frequency Air-Bone Gap in Meniere's Disease: Relationship With Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features of Endolymphatic Hydrops.
The appearance of low-frequency air-bone gaps (LFABGs) in Meniere's disease (MD) is a recognized but relatively unexplored phenomenon. Two theories have been proposed to explain their etiology: increased perilymphatic pressure resulting in either reduced stapedial mobility or dampened transmission of acoustic energy, and direct contact between the dilated saccule and the stapes footplate. The aim of this study was to evaluate these two hypotheses by comparing delayed postgadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of two groups of patients with unilateral definite MD, those with and without LFABGs.
This retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary otolaryngology unit in the United Kingdom. The study included 35 patients who satisfied the 2015 Barany criteria for unilateral definite MD. The cohort was divided into two groups, those with LFABGs (LFABG+ group) and those without (LFABG- group), according to the pure-tone audiometry performed within 6 months of MRI. Alternative potential causes for the LFABGs were excluded on the basis of otologic history, otoscopy, tympanometry, and/or imaging. Using a 4-hr delayed postgadolinium 3-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, two observers evaluated the severity of cochlear and vestibular endolymphatic hydrops (EH) and the presence of vestibular endolymphatic space contacting the oval window (VESCO). The air and bone conduction thresholds, ABGs and MRI features were compared between the LFABG+ and LFABG- groups. Where any of the variables were found to be significantly associated with the presence of ABGs, further analysis was performed to determine whether or not they were independent predictors. Continuous variables were compared using the independent t test if normally distributed, and the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskall-Wallis test if not normally distributed. Categorical variables were compared with Pearson's Chi-squared test or Fishers/Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests.
There were 10 patients in the LFABG+ group (28.6%) and 25 patients in the LFABG- group (71.4%). The mean ABGs in the symptomatic ear at 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz were 15.1 dB ± 6.4, 10.5 dB ± 9.0, and 4.0 dB ± 7.7, respectively, in the LFABG+ group and 2.0 ± 5.8, 2.4 ± 4.4, and -0.8 ± 4.7 dB in the LFABG- group. The differences in ABGs between the two groups were statistically significant at all three test frequencies ( p < 0.001 at 500 Hz, p = 0.007 at 1 kHz, and p = 0.041 at 2 kHz). The presence of ABGs was significantly associated with both the grade of vestibular EH ( p = 0.049) and VESCO ( p = 0.009). Further analysis showed a statistically significant association between the grade of vestibular EH and VESCO ( p = 0.007), and only VESCO was an independent variable associated with the presence of LFABGs ( p = 0.045).
The study findings add to the existing body of evidence that LFABGs are a true audiological finding in MD and allow us to propose a mechanism. Analysis of delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI suggests that direct contact between the distended saccule and the inner surface of the stapes footplate is the more likely underlying pathophysiological mechanism for this audiometric phenomenon.

Consensus on MR Imaging of Endolymphatic Hydrops in Patients With Suspected Hydropic Ear Disease (Meniere).
Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) is considered the histological hallmark of Meniere's disease. Visualization of EH has been achieved by special sequences of inner ear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a gadolinium-based contrast agent 
via
 intravenous or intratympanic administration. Although it has been applied for more than 10 years since 2007, a unified view on this technique has not yet been achieved. This paper presents an expert consensus on MRI of endolymphatic hydrops in the following aspects: indications and contra-indications for patient selection, methods of contrast-agent administration (intravenous or intratympanic), MRI sequence selection, the specific scanning parameter settings, and standard image evaluation methods and their advantages and disadvantages. For each part of this consensus, a comment is attached to elucidate the reasons for the recommendation.

Non-contrast MRI of Inner Ear Detected Differences of Endolymphatic Drainage System Between Vestibular Migraine and Unilateral Ménière's Disease.
We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of some anatomical variables with regard to endolymphatic sac (ES) and duct (ED), measured by non-contrast three-dimensional sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions (3D-SPACE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in differentiating vestibular migraine (VM) from unilateral Ménière's disease (MD).
In this study, 81 patients with VM, 97 patients with unilateral MD, and 50 control subjects were enrolled. The MRI-visualized parameters, such as the distance between the vertical part of the posterior semicircular canal and the posterior fossa (MRI-PP distance) and visibility of vestibular aqueduct (MRI-VA), were measured bilaterally. The diagnostic value of the MRI-PP distance and MRI-VA visibility for differentiating VM from unilateral MD was examined.
(1) Compared with the VM patients, patients with unilateral MD exhibited shorter MRI-PP distance and poorer MRI-VA visibility. No differences in the MRI-PP distance and MRI-VA visibility were detected between patients with VM and control subjects. (2) No significant interaural difference in the MRI-PP distance and MRI-VA visibility was observed in patients with VM and those with unilateral MD, respectively. (3) Area under the curve (AUC) showed a low diagnostic value for the MRI-PP distance and MRI-VA visibility, respectively, in differentiating between the VM and unilateral MD.
Based on non-enhanced MRI-visualized measurement, anatomical variables with regard to the endolymphatic drainage system differed significantly between the patients with VM and those with unilateral MD. Further investigations are needed to improve the diagnostic value of these indices in differentiating VM from unilateral MD.

Efficiency of a novel middle ear pressure device for intractable definite Meniere's disease and delayed endolymphatic hydrops after certification by the public health insurance system in Japan.
Middle ear pressure therapy (MEPT) is effective in treating intractable vertigo in patients with definite Meniere's disease (MD) and delayed endolymphatic hydrops (DEH) refractory to conservative treatment. A novel middle ear pressure device, the EFET01
®
, which requires no transtympanic ventilation tubes, was developed in Japan, approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and has been used under Japanese national health insurance since September 2018.
To examine short-term therapeutic effect of MEPT using the ETET01
®
 compared with previous clinical trial results.
Patients selected according to Japan Society for Equilibrium Research (JSER) guidelines underwent MEPT using the EFET01 from September 2018 to July 2021, and 44 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical data analysed at 4 months after the start of MEPT were compared with those of the previous clinical trial for the EFET01.
MEPT using the EFET01 showed the same therapeutic efficacy as that of the previous clinical trial, i.e. improvement in the intensity and frequency of vertigo with no effect on hearing, even under JSER guidelines for proper use of MEPT.
MEPT using the EFET01 provided an effective treatment option for intractable vertigo in patients with definite MD and DEH.

Discordant horizontal-torsional nystagmus: a sign of posterior semicircular canal dysfunction.
In central as well as peripheral vestibular lesions, right-beating horizontal nystagmus is almost always associated with clockwise (top poles of the eyes beating to the right ear) torsional nystagmus when observed and vice versa (concordant nystagmus). This study aimed to determine the etiologies and mechanisms of horizontal and torsional nystagmus beating in the opposite directions (discordant nystagmus). We reviewed the medical records of 16 consecutive patients with discordant horizontal-torsional nystagmus who had been evaluated at the dizziness clinics of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (n = 11, from March 2003 to March 2021) and Korea University Medical Center (n = 5, from March 2019 to March 2021). The underlying etiologies included inferior vestibular neuritis (n = 7), Meniere's disease (n = 4), internuclear ophthalmoplegia (n = 3), medullary hemorrhage (n = 1), and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 1). The torsional nystagmus decreased during the gaze in the same direction (for instance, during rightward gaze in clockwise nystagmus) and increased during the gaze in the opposite direction. Head-impulse tests (HITs) were positive for the ipsilesional posterior canal (PC) in all 11 patients with unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy and two of the three patients with unilateral central vestibulopathy. Discordant horizontal-torsional nystagmus may be observed in peripheral as well as central lesions. Given the findings of HITs and modulation of spontaneous nystagmus during lateral gazes, discordant horizontal-torsional nystagmus may be ascribed to selective damage of the excitatory or inhibitory pathway from the PC that innervates the ipsilateral superior oblique and contralateral inferior rectus muscles.

Discrepancies in the caloric testing and video Head Impulse Test results in a case with bilateral lateral semicircular canal malformations.
Lateral semicircular canal (LSCC) malformations represent one of the most common types of inner ear malformation. As many cases of LSCC malformations are asymptomatic, detailed vestibular functions in such cases remain unclear. We present a case with bilateral LSCC malformations for whom the function of each vestibular organ was evaluated by caloric testing, video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP). Caloric testing showed canal paresis of the left side, whereas vHIT showed bilateral normal semicircular canal function. The results of VEMP indicated left saccular dysfunction. Discrepancies in caloric testing and vHIT results were observed and these discrepancies are thought to be due to endolymphatic hydrops rather than vestibular hypofunction, similar to that in Meniere disease.

Consensus on intratympanic drug delivery for Menière's disease.
Intratympanic (IT) drug delivery receives attention due to its effectivity in treatment for Menière's disease (MD). Due to the release of the consensuses and new evidence on IT drug delivery for MD have been published, the review with a view to supplementing the details of IT treatment of MD is indispensable.
The literatures on IT injection for MD treatment over the last two decades are retrieved, International consensus (ICON) on treatment of Menière's disease (2018), Clinical Practice Guideline (2020) and European Position statement on Diagnosis and Treatment of Meniere's Disease (2018) are taken into account for reference, and follow advice from experts from Europe, USA and China.
Experts agree on the following: (1) The effectiveness of IT methylprednisolone (ITM) on vertigo control seems to be somewhat better than that of IT dexamethasone (ITD), and ITM can restore hearing in some cases. (2) Due to the ototoxicity of aminoglycosides, the application of intratympanic gentamicin (ITG) in MD patients with good hearing is conservative. However, some studies suggest that ITG with low doses has no significant effect on hearing, which needs to be further proved by clinical studies with high levels of evidence. (3) Currently, generally accepted treatment endpoint of ITG is no vertigo attack in a 12-month period or a vestibular loss in objective tests in the affected ear.
More studies with high level of evidence are needed to evaluate the drug type, efficacy, and therapeutic endpoint of IT therapy for MD.

A Perspective for Ménière's Disease: In Silico Investigations of Dexamethasone as a Direct Modulator of AQP2.
Ménière's disease is a chronic illness characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo associated with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and aural pressure. This pathology strongly correlates with a dilatation of the fluid compartment of the endolymph, so-called hydrops. Dexamethasone is one of the therapeutic approaches recommended when conventional antivertigo treatments have failed. Several mechanisms of actions have been hypothesized for the mode of action of dexamethasone, such as the anti-inflammatory effect or as a regulator of inner ear water homeostasis. However, none of them have been experimentally confirmed so far. Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane water channels and are hence central in the regulation of transcellular water fluxes. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that dexamethasone could impact water fluxes in the inner ear by targeting AQP2. We addressed this question through molecular dynamics simulations approaches and managed to demonstrate a direct interaction between AQP2 and dexamethasone and its significant impact on the channel water permeability. Through compartmentalization of sodium and potassium ions, a significant effect of Na+ upon AQP2 water permeability was highlighted as well. The molecular mechanisms involved in dexamethasone binding and in its regulatory action upon AQP2 function are described.

The value of vestibular evoked myogenic potential and electrocochleography in unexplained aural fullness.
Unexplained aural fullness, after excluding external or middle ear diseases and vertigo, is not easily diagnosed.
The aim of this study is to determine the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) and electrocochleography (ECochG) abnormal rates in patients with unexplained aural fullness, and analyzed the relationship between unexplained aural fullness and endolymphatic hydrops (EH).
The VEMP and EcochG abnormal rates in 54 patients with unexplained aural fullness and 21 healthy volunteers, and the VEMP and EcochG abnormal rates in the four hearing loss groups were compared. The distribution of abnormal of VEMP and EcochG in age, sex or hearing loss groups were investigated.
The VEMP abnormal rate in patients was greater than that in healthy volunteers (
p
 = .000). The abnormal rate of VEMP was greater than the EcochG in patients (
p
 = .003). The VEMP abnormal rate was greater than the EcochG in patient with low-tone or high-tone hearing loss (
p
 = .008).
Abnormal of VEMP in a significant proportion of patients with unexplained aural fullness maybe indicative of EH, and EH was more likely to involve the utricle or saccule in patients with low- or high-tone hearing loss.

Expression of circadian clock genes in leukocytes of patients with Meniere's disease.
The underlying etiology of Meniere's disease (MD) is not completely clear, but the precipitated triggers may alter the circadian clock in patients with MD. This study aims to survey the expression of circadian clock genes in peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes of MD patients.
We investigated the expression of nine circadian clock genes in the PB leukocytes of patients with MD and normal controls using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
We observed significantly lower expression of 
PER1
 gene and higher expression of 
CLOCK
 gene in MD patients than those in normal controls (
p
 < 0.05). 
PER1
 did not associate with the degree of dizziness handicap in the patients with MD, but a lower expression of 
PER1
 was significantly correlated with higher pure tone average (PTA) and speech reception threshold of the affected ear (
p
 < 0.05). Patients with PTA > 30 dB had significantly lower 
PER1
 expression than those with PTA ≤30 dB in the affected ear (
p
 < 0.05). Our qRT-PCR result was validated by fewer positively stained leukocytes for PER1 protein in the MD patients using the immunocytochemical study.
Our study implies the alteration of the circadian clock in patients with MD. In particular, the downregulation of 
PER1
 correlated with the degree of hearing loss in the affected ear. 
PER1
 in PB leukocytes may be a potential marker for the progression of hearing loss in MD.

The Effect of Collagen Viscoelastoplasiticty on Reissner's Membrane Displacement: A Graphic Analysis.
The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of collagen viscoelastoplasticity on the bulge displacement of Reissner's membrane that is observed in endolymphatic hydrops and Meniere's disease.
Viscoelastoplastic load-deformation characteristics for Reissner's membrane were based on a reported collagen polymer model of the cochleo-saccular membranes. The projected bulge displacements of Reissner's model membrane at key distention points were quantified trigonometrically and plotted graphically.
Initial deformation is characterized by a membrane laxity with substantial stretch at low tension with projected bulge displacement of Reissner's membrane approaching 30%. Intermediate deformation is characterized by a linear membrane stiffness with projected bulge displacement of Reissner's membrane in the range of 30-40%. Terminal deformation is characterized by reduced stiffness with a disproportionate increase in membrane stretch with projected bulge displacement of Reissner's membrane reaching a critical value of 50%, indicating a hemi-circular profile with imminent risk of rupture.
This collagen model of membrane viscoelastoplasticity demonstrates that at low pressure significant degrees of bulge displacement up to 30% can occur that may be reversible. The narrower 30-40% range of membrane displacement is one of the increasing deformity but without risk of rupture. Greater displacements approaching 50% indicate that the membrane is reaching a critical hemi-circular configuration with impending rupture.

Duration of symptom control following intratympanic dexamethasone injections in Meniere's disease.
Intratympanic (IT) injections of corticosteroids have emerged as a non-ablative alternative to gentamicin in the management of refractory Meniere's disease. However, currently, the duration of the symptom control achieved via intratympanic corticosteroids is under reported.
We retrospectively reviewed the notes of all patients who underwent IT injections of dexamethasone for the treatment of definite Meniere's disease at a single tertiary referral university centre over a 6-year period. We included demographic information, the number of procedures patients required, duration of symptom-control achieved (time interval between repeat IT injections), and the presence of co-morbidities, with a focus on the presence of autoimmune disease.
We identified 27 patients who underwent a total of 42 procedures; 23/27 (85.2%) patients demonstrated clinical response with a median period of symptom control of 14.5 months (range 1-64, IQR 10.25). The median longest asymptomatic period per patient was 19 months (range 11-64, IQR: 18). Interestingly, all patients with autoimmune disease (7/27) demonstrated a clinical response; autoimmune disease was found to be a statistically significant predictor of response to treatment (p = 0.002). In patients who received repeated treatment following disease relapse, there was no difference in duration of symptom-control achieved.
IT steroids can provide an effective alternative to gentamicin ablation. Symptom control is achieved for a median of 14.5 months, and treatment can be repeated with no loss of efficacy. Those patients who have an underlying autoimmune co-morbidity are more likely to demonstrate a clinical response to therapy, which may provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology of Meniere's disease.

Discordant vestibulo-ocular reflex function according to the frequency and mode of stimulation.
This study aimed to determine the incidence, pattern, and etiology of dissociated vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function according to the stimulus frequency in dizzy patients. We retrospectively evaluated the results of bithermal caloric tests and video-head impulse tests (vHITs) in 1022 patients with dizziness or vertigo between July 2016 and April 2021. Patients were classified into concordant group (normal or abnormal results on both tests) and discordant group (dissociated results between two tests). Of 1022 patients, discordant group had 159 (16%), comprising abnormal horizontal vHITs with normal caloric responses (n = 36, 23%) and abnormal caloric tests with normal horizontal vHITs (n = 123, 77%). The former group showed similar frequency of peripheral (44%) and central (42%) causes, and more common involvement of bilateral horizontal semicircular canals in central than peripheral causes (86.7 vs 37.5%, p = 0.005). The most common peripheral causes were Meniere's disease and chronic vestibular neuritis, while central causes were variable, but mainly affecting the cerebellum. In the latter group, peripheral causes were common (67%), with the main etiologies being Meniere's disease and vestibular neuritis, whereas central causes were found in only 5%. The degree of canal paresis did not differ significantly between patients with central and peripheral causes. Discordant VOR function according to the stimulus frequency was not uncommon in dizzy patients. Specific patterns of VOR dissociation according to the disease etiologies may offer insight into underlying pathophysiology.

Association Between Meniere Disease and Migraine.
A connection between Meniere disease (MD) and migraine has been proposed, but the temporal association remains unknown.
To examine the bidirectional association of MD with migraine.
This case-control study included participants 40 years or older from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Health Screening Cohort from 2002 to 2015.
A total of 6919 patients with MD were matched with 27 676 control participants without MD for age, sex, income, region of residence, and index date. The incidence of migraine was analyzed in the MD and matched groups using a stratified Cox proportional hazard regression model. In addition, 35 889 patients with migraine were matched with 71 778 control participants without migraine. The incidence of MD was analyzed using a stratified Cox proportional hazard regression model.
Of 142 262 total participants, 94 611 (66.5%) were women. Migraine occurred in 695 of 6919 patients with MD (10.0%) and 970 of 27 676 matched control participants (3.5%). The MD group demonstrated a 2.22-fold higher risk of migraine than the matched control group (95% CI, 1.99-2.49). Meniere disease was present in 1098 of 35 889 patients with migraine (3.1%) and 781 of 71 778 matched control participants (1.1%). The migraine group had a 1.95-fold higher risk of MD than the matched control group (95% CI, 1.77-2.15).
The results of this case-control study suggest that patients with MD had a greater risk of migraine occurrence. Furthermore, patients with migraine had a higher risk of MD. Based on the bidirectional association, therapeutics for migraine could potentially be applied to MD and vice versa.

Relationship Between the Onset of Ménière's Disease and Sympathetic Hyperactivity.
The pathogenesis of Ménière's disease is still largely unknown; however, it is known to be strongly associated with stress. Excessive stress can cause hyperactivity of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system. With the aim of understanding changes in sympathetic hyperactivity before and after Ménière's disease, we compared autonomic nervous function in patients in a stable phase of Ménière's disease and that in healthy adults. We also gathered data over about 10 years on autonomic nervous function immediately before a Ménière's attack.
Prospective study.
Autonomic nervous function was analyzed in 129 patients in a stable phase of Ménière's disease 31 healthy adult volunteers. In nine patients, autonomic nervous function was also measured immediately before and after treatment of a vertigo attack.
Power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) of EEG/ECG and an infrared electronic pupillometer were used. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous function was measured.
There were no statistically significant differences in autonomic nervous function determined by HRV and electronic pupillometry between patients in a stable phase of Ménière's disease and healthy adults. Sympathetic function as measured by electronic pupillometry parameters VD and T5 showed no difference between the affected and unaffected sides in the baseline data measured in the stable phase (VD: affected side is 31.02 ± 6.16 mm/sec, unaffected side is 29.25 ± 5.73 mm/sec; T5: affected side is 3.37 ± 0.43 msec, unaffected side is 3.25 ± 0.39 msec). In contrast, all nine patients whose HRV data had been obtained just before an attack showed marked suppression of the parasympathetic nervous system and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Electronic pupillometry also revealed an overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system on the affected side, just before the attacks. Analysis of sequential changes after the onset of an attack revealed that overactivation on the affected side was reduced after treatment, and no difference between affected and unaffected sides was observed 3 days after treatment.
Detailed analysis of autonomic nervous function showed that immediately before an attack of Ménière's disease, the sympathetic nervous system on the affected side was strongly overactivated.

Low-Dose Intratympanic Gentamicin for Unilateral Ménière's Disease: Accuracy of Early Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex Gain Reduction in Predicting Long-Term Clinical Outcome.
The number of intratympanic gentamicin (ITG) injections needed to achieve vertigo control in patients with intractable Ménière's disease (MD) may vary from a single dose to several instillations. Changes in different vestibular test results have been used to define an endpoint of treatment, including the decrease of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain elicited by the head-impulse test.
To assess the accuracy of the VOR gain reduction after horizontal canal stimulation, as measured with the video head-impulse test (vHIT) 1 month after the first intratympanic injection, in predicting the need for one or more instillations to control vertigo spells in the long term.
The VOR gain reduction was calculated in 47 patients submitted to (ITG) therapy 1 month after the first instillation.
Single intratympanic treatment with gentamicin has a 59.6% efficacy in vertigo control in the long term. Hearing change in the immediate period after treatment (1 month) is not significant to pre-treatment result and is similar for patients who needed multiple doses due to recurrence. Chronic disequilibrium and the need for vestibular rehabilitation were less frequent in patients with a good control of vertigo with just one single injection of gentamicin. A fair accuracy was obtained for the VOR gain reduction of the horizontal canal (area under the curve = 0.729 in the Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis) in predicting the need for one or more ITG.
Single intratympanic treatment with gentamicin is an effective treatment for patients with MD. That modality of treatment has very limited damaging effect in hearing. The degree of vestibular deficit induced by the treatment is significant as measured by the reduction in the gain of the VOR but not useful for prognostic purposes.

Efficacy of Resection of Lateral Wall of Endolymphatic Sac for Treatment of Meniere's Disease.
To explore the long-term efficacy and safety of resection of the lateral wall of the endolymphatic sac for the treatment of intractable Meniere's disease (MD) as an alternative surgical procedure for treating this disorder.
Data from 73 patients who were referred to our hospital and diagnosed with unilateral MD between January 2015 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Seventy-three patients who had frequent vertigo even after receiving standardized conservative treatment for at least half a year underwent resection of the lateral wall of the endolymphatic sac. Vertigo control and auditory function were assessed. Pure tone audiometry, caloric test, and vestibular evoked myogenic potential were performed to evaluate audiological and vestibular functions. The post-operative follow-up duration was more than 2 years.
Among the 73 patients (male 34 cases, female 39 cases; age 20-69 years, average 51.4), vertigo was controlled effectively for 66 cases (90.4%) after 2 years of follow-up; 45 cases (61.6%) were completely controlled, and 21 cases (28.8%) were substantially controlled in this study. The patients of 16.4% had hearing loss with more than 10 dB change based on the four-tone average (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz). No patient had a facial nerve weakness, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or other complications.
Resection of the lateral wall of the endolymphatic sac, which can effectively control vertiginous symptoms in intractable MD patients, represents an effective and safe therapy for this disease. Resection of the lateral wall of the endolymphatic sac is expected to be used as an alternative treatment for MD.

Factors determining the response to treatment in patients with vestibular migraine.
To find out clinical features associated with poor response to treatment in vestibular migraine (VM).
VM patients treated with drugs recommended in migraine prophylaxis were included in this multicenter study. Migraine features including type, age of onset of headache and vertigo attacks, attack frequency, intensity, associated symptoms, triggering factors, presence of interictal dizziness/imbalance, anxiety, depression, history of motion sickness, and family history of migraine were noted. Amitriptyline, flunarizine, propranolol, topiramate and venlafaxine were chosen depending on patients' individual requirements. Maximum dose of each drug was tried for 2 months to decide its efficacy. In the case of inefficacy, it was changed with another preventive drug of different class. If there was still no improvement, two drugs of different classes were combined. ≥ 50% reduction in attack frequency and severity in patients using one drug and a combination of two drugs was compared, with patients showing <50% reduction despite combination therapy, regarding their clinical features.
The results of 430 VM patients, 65 men and 365 women with a mean age of 42.2 ± 12.2 years (range: 17-74 years), were analyzed.
Cutaneous allodynia frequently associated with female sex, comorbid anxiety and depression and interictal dizziness/imbalance enhanced with comorbid anxiety were risk factors for reduced treatment response. Aural fullness might be the clue of impending concomitant Meniere's disease not responding to migraine preventives.

[Dynamic changes of vestibular autorotation test in patients with unilateral vestibular dysfunction during rehabilitation].
Objective:
 To explore the dynamic changes of vestibular autorotation test (VAT) before and after vestibular rehabilitation treatment in patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction (UVH). 
Methods:
 A retrospective study was carried out,48 patients who were diagnosed with UVH and under vestibular rehabilitation in department of otorhinolaryngology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 2019 to January 2021 were enrolled. Among them, there were 21 males and 27 females, with an average age of 46.9 years old, including 25 cases of Meniere's disease, 13 cases of sudden deafness with vertigo and 10 cases of vestibular neuritis. The course of disease ranged from 5 days to 10 years. Demographic characteristics, detailed case data and routine examination were collected for the patients. The horizontal gain/phase, vertical gain/phase, and asymmetry of VAT at different frequencies before and after vestibular rehabilitation were collected. The absolute value of the difference between the measured value of 2.0-5.9 Hz before and after rehabilitation and the standard value were statistically analyzed. 
Results:
 Before vestibular rehabilitation, the incidence of abnormal gain was 62.5% (30/48), the incidence of abnormal phase was 56.3% (27/48), and the incidence of asymmetry was 16.7% (8/48). After 4-6 weeks of vestibular rehabilitation, the incidence of gain abnormality was 22.9% (11/48), the incidence of phase abnormality was 31.3% (15/48), and the incidence of asymmetry was 12.5% (6/48).The horizontal gain at frequency of 2.0-3.9 Hz showed statistically significant difference compared with before vestibular rehabilitation (
P
<0.05), and the horizontal gain at frequency of 4.3-5.9 Hz showed that there was no significant difference (
P
>0.05); the horizontal phase at 5.9 Hz showed that the difference was statistically significant (
P
=0.043), and there was no significant difference before and after rehabilitation treatment at 2.0-5.5 Hz (
P
>0.05); the vertical gain at 4.3 Hz showed the difference was statistically significant (
P
=0.020), and the remaining frequency showed no significant difference (
P
>0.05); No frequency of asymmetry and vertical phase showed the difference before and after rehabilitation was statistically significant (
P
>0.05). 
Conclusion:
 VAT can be used to monitor the change trend of multiple frequency bands before and after vestibular rehabilitation in UVH, in order to provide reference for the formulation of personalized rehabilitation strategies.

Intratympanic gentamicin compared with placebo for Ménière's disease.
Ménière's disease is a multifactorial disorder affecting the inner ear, characterized by episodes of spontaneous and recurrent vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus. Intratympanic gentamicin therapy has been used to reduce the intensity and frequency of attacks in intractable Ménière's disease, but it is associated with hearing loss. There is controversy regarding its efficacy and safety.
We searched in Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed data of primary studies, conducted a meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings table using the GRADE approach.
We identified 13 systematic reviews that included 80 primary studies overall, of which three correspond to randomized trials. We concluded that intratympanic gentamicin may improve the control of vertigo, and result in little or no difference to tinnitus, but the certainty of the evidence is low. Furthermore, we are uncertain whether intratympanic gentamicin reduces hearing or the frequency of vertigo attacks as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low.

NaCl exposure results in increased expression and processing of IL-1β in Meniere's disease patients.
Meniere's disease (MD) is a chronic disease that causes episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and aural fullness, initially managed by dietary salt reduction, and use of diuretics. Our prior research in autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) demonstrated that in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from corticosteroid-resistant AIED patients, increased production, processing and release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is observed and hearing could be improved with use of anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. We have further identified that in these AIED patients, IL-1β is uniquely processed to a 28 kDa pro-inflammatory product by caspase-7. In the present study, we characterize the production, processing and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 from PBMC of MD (n = 14) patients in response to sodium chloride (NaCl), and determined the effect of the diuretic triamterene-hydrocholothiazide (T-HCTZ), or anakinra in these patients. We observed that PBMC cultured with NaCl from MD patients show processing of IL-1β to the 28 kDa product, and that this product is abrogated with T-HCTZ. Our observations are consistent with other autoimmune diseases where high concentrations of NaCl caused release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may provide further insight as to the mechanism of disease progression in MD patients.

Benign Recurrent Vertigo: The Course of Vertigo Attacks Compared to Patients With Menière's Disease and Vestibular Migraine.
To explore the course of vertigo attacks in patients with benign recurrent vertigo (BRV) as compared to patients with Menière's disease (MD) and vestibular migraine (VM).
Prospective cohort study.
Tertiary referral center.
Adult patients who visited the Apeldoorn Dizziness Center between January 2015 and November 2016 and who were diagnosed with BRV, VM or MD. During 3 years participants were contacted every 6 months by telephone to complete a study-specific questionnaire.
Vertigo attack frequency, use of medication, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
The study population (
n
 = 121) consisted of 44 patients with BRV, 34 with VM, and 43 with MD. For the total follow-up period no statistically significant differences between the three diagnosis groups were observed for being attack-free in the past 6 months: OR = 0.86 (95% CI 0.34-2.17; 
p
 = 0.745) for VM and OR = 1.06 (95% CI 0.44-2.51; 
p
 = 0.902) for MD, compared to BRV. Overall, 19 patients (43.2%) with BRV, 13 (38.2%) with VM, and 35 (81.0%) with MD used medication to prevent vertigo attacks at any point during their 3-year follow-up. Throughout the observation period patients with MD showed an average of 3.37 points (95% CI 0.68-6.07; 
p
 = 0.014) higher HADS scores relative to patients with BRV.
The course of vertigo attacks was rather favorable in the three groups, as 67-70% of the patients were free of vertigo attacks after 3 years of follow-up. The course of disease in patients with BRV was not distinctive from patients with MD and VM. We assume that BRV is a mild or incomplete variant of VM and MD, rather than a separate disease entity with distinct pathognomonic features.

Vestibular migraine, demographic and clinical features of 415 patients: A multicenter study.
To evaluate demographic and clinical features of vestibular migraine (VM) patients METHODS: Four hundred fifteen patients with VM were evaluated by using a structured questionnaire in addition to clinical examination.
The mean age of headache and vertigo onset was 25 years and 39 years, respectively. In 12.3%, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was detected during the interictal period. Ten percent had hearing loss on audiometry, in 8.7% it was one-sided low-frequency sensory-neural hearing loss below 2000 Hz and the history was typical for Meniere's disease (MD) in addition to VM. Tinnitus was present in 94.4%, aural fullness in 83.4%, nausea in 72.2% and vomiting in 30.5% of patients with VM/MD. The prevalence of these symptoms was higher in patients with VM/MD than in pure VM. Median attack severity determined by visual analog scale measured in centimeters from 0 to 10 was 8 for headache and 7 for vertigo for the whole group. Severe headache was significantly correlated with age of ≤ 43 years (OR: 6.831, 95% CI: [4.10-11.63]; p < 0.001) and severe vertigo was significantly correlated with age ≥ 41 years (OR: 7.073, 95% CI: [4.55-10.98]; p < 0.001). Motion sickness was revealed from past medical history in 51.8%. Family history of migraine was present in 72.5% and the age of onset of both migraine headaches (p = 0.008) and vertigo attacks (p = 0.004) was lower in these patients.
Younger patients suffered more severe headache attacks whereas vertigo attack severity was higher in the elderly. BPPV and MD were commonly associated with VM and VM/MD was accompanied by aural and autonomic features more frequently than pure VM. Previous history of motion sickness was detected in more than half of the whole group. Family history of migraine was associated with younger onset of migraine headaches and vertigo attacks.

Clinical application of MIIRMR as a salvage method in gadolinium-enhanced MRI after intra-tympanic injection.
Three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (3 D-FLAIR) and real inversion-recovery (3 D-real IR) sequences are used to detect endolymphatic hydrops (EH), but medium inversion-time inversion-recovery imaging with magnitude reconstruction (MIIRMR) may be more sensitive.
We investigated the inner-ear visualisation success rate and EH detection rates of 3 D-FLAIR and 3 D-real IR, and whether salvage MIIRMR could improve EH detection.
Fifty-one patients (102 ears) with episodic or chronic vestibular syndrome were injected intra-tympanically with 8-fold diluted gadolinium, and 3 D-FLAIR and 3 D-real IR images obtained 24-h post-injection. If 3 D-FLAIR inner-ear visualisation failed, additional MIIRMR was performed. The success and EH detection rate increase by MIIRMR was calculated. The diagnostic performance of combined MIIRMR + 3D-FLAIR + 3D-real IR for Meniere's disease (MD) was evaluated.
The success rates of 3 D-FLAIR and 3 D-real IR were 88.90% and 72.55%, respectively. MIIRMR increased the success and EH detection rates by 11.10% and 6.86%, respectively. In MD, MIIRMR increased these rates by 10.53% and 10.53%, respectively. 3 D-FLAIR + 3D-real IR + MIIRMR had 92.11% sensitivity, 79.68% specificity, 72.92% positive-predictive value, and 94.44% negative-predictive value for MD diagnosis.
MIIRMR can improve success and EH detection rates when 3 D-FLAIR fails. Combined MIIRMR + 3D-FLAIR + 3D-real IR is more valuable for diagnosing MD than conventional sequences.

Up-Regulated Expression of Interferon-Gamma, Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha in the Endolymphatic Sac of Meniere's Disease Suggesting the Local Inflammatory Response Underlies the Mechanism of This Disease.
Immune mediated inflammatory changes affecting the endolymphatic sac (ES) may underlie the pathology of Meniere's disease (MD). The aim of the present study was to explore the differentially expressed cytokines in ES luminal fluid (ELF) of patients with MD, and the correlation between the expression of cytokines in the ELF with that in the serum was determined by quantitatively analyzing the cytokines in human ELF and serum.
Human ELF, serum and ES tissues were collected from patients with unilateral MD and patients with acoustic neuroma (AN) during surgery. The Simoa Cytokine 6-Plex Panel kit was used to analyze the levels of cytokines in the ELF and blood samples of the patients. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were subsequently used to validate the relative expression levels of the cytokines in MD.
Significant differences were identified in the expression levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (
P
 < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-6 (
P
 = 0.008) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (
P
 = 0.036) in the luminal fluid of the ES comparing between the MD and AN groups. By contrast, the levels of IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNF-α in the serum of the MD group were not significantly different from those of either the AN group or healthy control subjects. In addition, no significant correlations in the expression levels of cytokines compared between the ELF and serum were found for the patients in either the MD or the AN group. Finally, the detection of positive expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ in the epithelial cells of the majority of ES specimens from patients with MD confirmed the up-regulated expression of these cytokines in the ES of patients with MD.
The identification of up-regulated expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ in the ELF in the present study has provided direct evidence for an increased immunologic activity in the microenvironment of the ES in patients with unilateral MD, may suggest the local inflammatory response underlies the mechanism of this disease.

[The effectiveness of transtympanic use of dexamethasone 4 mg in Meniere's disease, severe and moderate course of the disease].
The results of transtympanic administration of 4 mg dexamethasone in 37 patients with moderate and severe Meniere's disease are presented. The endolymphatic hydrops was detected in all inner ear structures with predominant accumulation in vestibule and semicircular canals by MRI-visualization before therapy. After 1 month of 4 mg dexamethasone transtympanic therapy the hydrops degree decreased. Daily transtympanic administration of 4 mg dexamethasone for a month leads to reduction of vertigo attacks duration and expression in 92% of cases (follow-up period 24 months) and can be considered when conservative therapy is ineffective before destructive surgical interventions.

A Comparison of Local Endolymphatic Sac Decompression, Endolymphatic Mastoid Shunt, and Wide Endolymphatic Sac Decompression in the Treatment of Intractable Meniere's Disease: A Short-Term Follow-Up Investigation.
Meniere's disease (MD) is an inner ear disorder, characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo, low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Endolymphatic sac surgery is an effective treatment to control vertigo attacks but without causing a hearing loss for intractable MD. However, the methods and effects of endolymphatic sac surgery have been controversial for many years, and the relationship between the vertigo control rates of different endolymphatic sac surgery methods is not well-documented.
This study compared the vertigo control rate, hearing outcome, and quality of life (QOL) among different endolymphatic sac surgery, such as local endolymphatic sac decompression (LESD), endolymphatic sac mastoid shunt (ESMS), and wide endolymphatic sac decompression (WESD).
We retrospectively analyzed the patients who underwent endolymphatic sac surgery from January 2008 to June 2019. The control rate of vertigo and QOL scores were compared after 2 years of follow-up. The QOL was scored with validation of the MD patient-oriented symptom-severity index (MDPOSI). The pure tone thresholds of all patients at pre- and postoperation were also compared.
In total, 83 MD patients with complete follow-up data were included in the study, i.e., 20 patients with LESD, 28 patients with ESMS, and 35 patients with WESD. Results showed a better vertigo control with WESD than the other groups (70% with LESD, 71.4% with ESMS, and 88.6% with WESD). The QOL was improved after surgery in all groups in which the difference was statistically significant (QOL, preoperative vs. postoperative, 38.2 vs. 10.1 with LESD, 37.8 vs. 9.6 with ESMS, and 37.6 vs. 8.3 with WESD), respectively. After endolymphatic sac surgery, the hearing was well-preserved in the three groups [pure tone averages (PTAs), dB, preoperative vs. postoperative, 41.0 ± 19.3 vs. 40.8 ± 17.9 with LESD, 39.7 ± 16.4 vs. 40.8 ± 18.2 with ESMS, and 38.5 ± 18.7 vs. 36.6 ± 19.5 with WESD].
Wide endolymphatic sac decompression has a higher vertigo control rate, better improvement of QOL, and relatively higher hearing stability or improvement rate after surgery in patients with MD compared with LESD and ESMS.

Supervised machine learning models for classifying common causes of dizziness.
The objective of this study was to use a supervised machine learning (ML) platform and a national dataset to identify factors important in classifying common types of dizziness.
Using established clinical criteria and responses to the balance and dizziness supplement from the 2016 National health Interview Survey (n = 33,028), case definitions for vestibular migraine (VM), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) Ménière's disease (MD), persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD), superior canal dehiscence (SCD), and bilateral vestibular hypofunction (BVH) were generated. One hundred thirty-six variables consisting of sociodemographic characteristics and medical comorbidities were used to develop decision tree models to predict these common types of dizziness.
The one-year prevalence of dizziness in the U.S. was 16.8% (5562 respondents). VM was highly prevalent, representing 4.0% of the overall respondents (n = 1327). ML decision tree models were able to correctly classify all 6 dizziness subtypes with high accuracy (sensitivity range, 70-92%; specificity range, 89-99%) using responses to questions about functional limitations due to dizziness, such as falls due to dizziness and modification of social activities due to dizziness.
In a large population-based dataset, supervised ML models accurately predicted dizziness subtypes according to responses to questions that do not pertain to dizziness symptoms alone.

Vestibular Nerve Section via Middle Cranial Fossa Approach.
Vestibular nerve section (VNS) is a surgical intervention with hearing preservation used for the treatment of Menière's disease after conservative medical therapy has failed (1,2). With the recent rise in less invasive treatments such as intratympanic gentamicin, VNS has been performed less frequently (3). The middle cranial fossa (MCF) approach for VNS is an uncommon approach due to its technical difficulty. However, it can provide the best distinction of internal auditory canal contents compared with retrosigmoid and retrolabyrinthine approaches. Several advancements in the MCF approach have been described, including the use of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring with electromyography, early removal of the temporal lobe retractor, and the use of an ultrasonic bone aspirator for internal auditory canal decompression (4-6). We demonstrate a case study with a step-by-step approach to successfully sectioning the superior and inferior vestibular nerves while utilizing these advancements and avoiding facial and cochlear nerve injury via the MCF (7).

Endolymphatic Sac Tumor as a Ménière-Like Vertiginous Syndrome: A Case Report.
Endolymphatic sac tumors are rare benign neoplasms with locally aggressive behavior located in the posterior petrous ridge of the temporal bone. They cause sensorineural hearing loss and may develop vestibular damage. A 24-year-old male patient arrived at our office with a history of acute vertiginous syndrome, left hearing loss, and tinnitus 1-year ago. His chief complaint was an increase in auditory symptoms. A CT scan and MRI showed an endolymphatic sac tumor. Complete resection of the lesion was achieved by a transmastoid and translabyrinthine approach. Low-grade adenocarcinoma was confirmed by histopathology. The patient remained without clinical vestibular symptoms. However, a small residual tumor was addressed by gamma-ray radiosurgery. Postoperative deep left sensorineural hearing loss was identified, without any vestibular sequelae. Radiologic imaging is the most useful tool for this diagnosis. Endolymphatic sac tumors should be in the differential diagnosis of recalcitrant audio-vestibular symptoms. Complete surgical resection is the most appropriate management.

Does the Self-training in Ménière's Disease Fit the Disease Characteristics and Help Alleviate the Balance Problems?
To examine whether the self-initiated exercise in Ménière's disease fits the characteristics of the balance problems.
This retrospective study included 539 people with Ménière's disease belonging to the Finnish Ménière Federation. The mean age was 61.9 years with a mean history of Ménière's disease of 15.6 years. The data were collected with an online questionnaire.
In total, 30% of the patients did not do any training, 23% did training once a week, 22% did 2-3 times a week, and 26% did the training daily. The most common training exercises were different self-training exercises (26%) followed by walking (16%), guided training (15%), viewing plus balance training (10%), and viewing training (4%). Non-defined balance problems (18%) were associated with recent vertigo attacks. Swaying type of balance problems were present in 23% and they used all types of training programs. Rocking type of balance disorder was present in 8% and they preferred guided training exercises. Tripping off type of balance disorder was present in 25% and they preferred viewing plus balance training.
The type of self-training used was related to the type of balance problems reported. When choosing the vestibular rehabilitation in Ménière's disease , the type of balance disorder should be characterized and the rehabilitation program should be individually tailored.

Speech Recognition During Follow-Up of Patients with Ménière's Disease: What Are We Missing?
Hearing loss causes a significant reduction in the quality of life of patients with Ménière's disease. Although speech recognition is also affected, it has not been extensively studied. The objective of the study was to describe speech recognition behavior during a prolonged period in patients with unilateral Ménière's disease.
A prospective case-control study was performed. The case group included patients with defined unilateral Ménière's disease and the control group included patients with progressive non-fluctuating hearing loss. Patients underwent an auditory evaluation periodically. Pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition tests-speech recognition threshold and speech discrimination score-were administered. The dissociation between pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition was assessed through a linear regression analysis. During follow-up, Ménière's disease patients were subdivided into a stable and fluctuating subgroup (a change of >20% in the speech discrimination score with a change no greater than 15 dB in pure-tone audiometry).
The average follow-up time was 79.9 months. Fifty-seven patients were included (30 cases, 27 controls). Dissociation between puretone audiometry and speech recognition threshold began to appear in the case group after 21 months, and it was statistically significant at 108 months. Duration of the disease was the only variable studied that influenced the dissociation. The fluctuation subgroup in cluded 56.6% of the cases.
We described 2 audiological peculiarities in Ménière's disease patients: dissociation between pure-tone audiometry and speech recognition during the evolution of the disease and the fluctuation of speech recognition regardless of the change in pure-tone audiometry. Our results highlight the importance of performing speech recognition tests during follow-up in patients with Ménière's disease.

[Vestibular rehabilitation in patients with vestibular peripheral vertigo].
Objective:
To evaluate the efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation in patients with anterior peripheral vertigo and analyze its influencing factors. 
Methods:
From January 2018 to June 2021, 153 cases with peripheral vertigo diseases（including 47 cases of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, 38 cases of Meniere's disease, 26 cases of sudden deafness with vertigo, 23 cases of vestibular migraine and 19 cases of vestibular neuritis） were enrolled. One hundred and three cases were treated with vestibular rehabilitation combined with drugs, and 50 cases only treated with drugs were used as controls. Self-rating scale and vertigo disorder scale were evaluated at the beginning of treatment, 4 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively. The curative effects of the two groups were tested by 
t
-test, and the independent risk factors affecting the curative effects were analyzed by multiple linear regression. 
Results:
There was no difference in clinical data, self-assessment scale and vertigo disorder scale between the two groups（
P
>0.05）. At 4 and 8 weeks, the scores of self-assessment scale and vertigo disorder scale in the experimental group were better than those in the control group（all 
P
<0.01）, and the curative effect at 8 weeks was better than that at 4 weeks, especially the decrease of emotional score during walking and the proportion of severe vertigo disability（all 
P
<0.01）. The scores of self-rating scale and vertigo disorder scale of the cases with benign positional paroxysmal vertigo and vestibular neuritis were better than Meniere's disease, vestibular migraine and sudden deafness with vertigo（
P
<0.05）. Headache（
P
<0.05） and severe vertigo disorder before intervention（
P
<0.01） were independent risk factors affecting the efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation. 
Conclusion:
Vestibular rehabilitation combined with anti-vertigo drugs in the treatment of vestibular peripheral vertigo is better than that of only using drugs, especially in improving the degree of emotional disorder and vertigo disability. It is more suitable for benign positional paroxysmal vertigo and vestibular neuritis, while the effect of combined headache or severe vertigo is relatively poor.

Vestibular Aqueduct Morphology and Meniere's Disease-Development of the "Vestibular Aqueduct Score" by 3D Analysis.
Improved radiological examinations with newly developed 3D models may increase understanding of Meniere's disease (MD). The morphology and course of the vestibular aqueduct (VA) in the temporal bone might be related to the severity of MD. The presented study explored, if the VA of MD and non-MD patients can be grouped relative to its angle to the semicircular canals (SCC) and length using a 3D model. Scans of temporal bone specimens (TBS) were performed using micro-CT and micro flat panel volume computed tomography (mfpVCT). Furthermore, scans were carried out in patients and TBS by computed tomography (CT). The angle between the VA and the three SCC, as well as the length of the VA were measured. From these data, a 3D model was constructed to develop the vestibular aqueduct score (VAS). Using different imaging modalities it was demonstrated that angle measurements of the VA are reliable and can be effectively used for detailed diagnostic investigation. To test the clinical relevance, the VAS was applied on MD and on non-MD patients. Length and angle values from MD patients differed from non-MD patients. In MD patients, significantly higher numbers of VAs could be assigned to a distinct group of the VAS. In addition, it was tested, whether the outcome of a treatment option for MD can be correlated to the VAS.

Changes of Vestibular Symptoms in Menière's Disease After Triple Semicircular Canal Occlusion: A Long-Term Follow-Up Study.
The clinical efficacy of triple semicircular canal occlusion (TSCO) and vestibular nerve resection (VNS) for patients with Ménière's disease has been unclear.
To explore changes in vestibular symptoms after TSCO and its advantages compared to the classical operation of VNS in patients with Menière's disease.
In total, 36 patients with Menière's disease performed TSCO or VNS at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China from May 2005 to July 2021, and all of them were enrolled in our study. Twelve of them underwent TSCO, 23 underwent VNS, and 1 had both treatments. We compared the demographic parameters, clinical symptoms, and selected test results between the two surgical methods. Ten patients each who underwent TSCO and VNS completed the follow-up. We collected and compared data pertaining to changes in vestibular symptoms.
No significant difference in demographic parameters, clinical symptoms, or auditory or vestibular test results was detected between the two groups preoperatively. The TSCO group with vertigo as the main complaint experienced less residual paroxysmal dizziness after surgery than the VNS group (
P
 = 0.020). Also, 57% of the patients in the VNS group had unsteadiness after surgery, while no such problems were reported in the TSCO group (
P
 = 0.025).
Our study shows that TSCO controls vertigo in most Menière's disease patients, and also has the advantage of lower rates of postoperative paroxysmal dizziness and unsteadiness than VNS. Thus, TSCO may be an effective surgery for refractory Menière's disease.

Endolymphatic Hydrops Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Menire's Disease Patients on a Vertigo Attack.
To investigate the characteristics of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in Menire's disease (MD) patient on a vertigo attack.
Prospective study.
Tertiary referral center.
Thirty-six MD patients underwent the enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of the inner ear on a vertigo attack were enrolled.
All patients met the diagnostic criteria for MD and underwent intravenous gadolinium injection 4 hours before the MRI examinations. The MRI examinations were performed in MD patients on a vertigo attack.
Various degrees of vestibular EH appeared in almost all affected ears (2 ears had no EH, 11 ears had mild EH, 26 ears had significant EH). The positive rate of vestibular EH was 37/39 (94.9%). Cochlear EH occurred in 29 ears among 39 affected ears (17 ears had mild EH, 12 ears had significant EH).
MRI with intravenous gadolinium injection can provide a better assessment of EH in MD patient on a vertigo attack. Vestibular EH seems to be closely related with the vertigo attacks in MD patients, which needs further study.

Differential Involvement of Lateral Semicircular Canal and Otolith Organs in Common Vestibular Disorders.
Semicircular canal and otolith functions came to be evaluated recently, but comprehensive and comparative analysis of canal and otolith dysfunction in common vestibular disorders is lacking. We aimed to analyze the abnormal rates of canal and otolith function in common vestibular disorders. We enrolled 302 patients who were managed for 2 months in a dizziness clinic. Results of caloric, video head impulse test (vHIT), and cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP and oVEMP) tests were analyzed and compared among various diagnoses. Vestibular disorders diagnosed included recurrent vestibulopathy (RV, 27%), vestibular migraine (VM, 21%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV, 17%), Meniere's disease (MD, 11%), vestibular neuritis (VN, 10%), orthostatic dizziness (7%), and central lesions (3%). Lateral canal dysfunction was found most in VN (100%) and less commonly in definite MD (75%), RV (46%) and definite VM (29%). Abnormal caloric results were more common than abnormal vHIT in all disorders. Otolith dysfunction was found more frequently than lateral canal dysfunction in most vestibular disorders except VN. An abnormal cVEMP was more frequent in definite MD than the other disorders. Isolated otolith dysfunction without lateral canal dysfunction was the most found in BPPV, followed by definite VM, RV, and definite MD in decreasing order. Various patterns of involvement in canal and otoliths were revealed in vestibular disorders, suggesting different pathogenesis.

Contrast-Enhanced Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery in Neuroimaging: A Narrative Review on Clinical Applications and Technical Advances.
While contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) has long been regarded as an adjunct sequence to evaluate leptomeningeal disease in addition to contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, it is gradually being used for more diverse pathologies beyond leptomeningeal disease. Contrast-enhanced FLAIR is known to be highly sensitive to low concentrations of gadolinium within the fluid. Accordingly, recent research has suggested the potential utility of contrast-enhanced FLAIR in various kinds of disease, such as Meniere's disease, seizure, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and brain metastasis, in addition to being used for visualizing glymphatic dysfunction. However, its potential applications have been reported sporadically in an unorganized manner. Furthermore, the exact mechanism for its superior sensitivity to low concentrations of gadolinium has not been fully understood. Rapidly developing magnetic resonance technology and unoptimized parameters for FLAIR may challenge its accurate application in clinical practice. This review provides the fundamental mechanism of contrast-enhanced FLAIR, systematically describes its current and potential clinical application, and elaborates on technical considerations for its optimization.

Performance and self-perceived hearing impairment after cochlear implantation in Menière's disease.
Evaluation of the self-perceived hearing impairment and performance after cochlear implantation in patients with definite Menière's disease (MD).
Seventeen unilaterally or bilaterally profoundly hearing-impaired patients suffering from MD who received a cochlear implantat (CI) were eligible for inclusion in this study. Their self-perceived hearing impairment using the short 
Speech Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale
 (SSQ12) as well as their performance in speech perception (German language Freiburger mono- and multisyllable test, Oldenburger sentence test) were compared with a best-matched control group of non-MD patients up to 24 months of follow-up.
MD patients improved significantly in perception of monosyllables presented at 65 dB
SPL
, from preoperatively best aided 18.2% [2.4, 34.0] to 51.7% [39.4, 63.9] 1 year after cochlear implantation (mean [95% confidence interval]). Their performance approached the matched controls with 63.2% [55.7, 70.8]. Monosyllables presented at a lower intensity of 55 dB
SPL
 revealed a significant underperformance of the MD patients (21.1% [12.6, 29.6]) in contrast to the non-MD controls (39.1% [30.9, 47.4]) 12 months post-CI. Self-assessed hearing disability was significantly more pronounced in MD patients with a mean total SSQ12 score of 3.6 [2.4, 4.9] in comparison to 6.1 [5.4, 6.8] of the matched non-MD controls after 12 months of cochlear implantation.
Cochlear implantation substantially improves hearing capabilities in profoundly hearing-impaired patients with MD, but they tend to underperform in comparison to non-MD patients at least at lower sound pressure levels. This is likely one reason for the poorer self-assessed hearing function of cochlear implanted MD patients.

The Role of Wideband Tympanometry in the Diagnosis of Meniere's Disease.
Meniere's disease (MD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by spontaneous recurrent vertigo, usually accompanied by hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The cause of MD remains unclear and is generally considered to be associated with endolymphatic hydrops. Studies showed that patients with MD could have eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). ETD can disrupt the pressure balance between the middle and inner ear and impair the inner ear's function. In recent years, several studies have attempted to identify MD by using wideband tympanometry (WBT). However, there are limited studies in this area. There is no consensus on how to use WBT to diagnose Meniere's disease. Therefore, we endeavored to conduct a narrative review in this aspect based on the latest research findings. Reduction in resonance frequency and absorbance are characteristic of MD and can identify Meniere's disease. The use of an increase in the integrated area of absorbance as an indicator for identifying MD is controversial. WBT seems to be ineffective as a diagnostic tool during the acute episodes of Meniere's disease. Patients with MD may benefit from WBT. WBT has excellent potential for future use in Meniere's disease. However, further large sample sizes, multicenter studies are needed.

Comparison between 3D SPACE FLAIR and 3D TSE FLAIR in Menière's disease.
Heavily T2-weighted 3D FLAIR (hT
2
w-3D-FLAIR) sequence with constant flip angle (CFA) has been reported as being more sensitive to low concentrations of gadolinium (Gd) enabling endolymphatic hydrops (EH) visualization. The purpose of this study was to compare signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, detection rate of EH, and increased perilymphatic enhancement (PE) as well as diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing definite Menière's disease (MD), using 3D-SPACE FLAIR versus conventional 3D-TSE FLAIR.
This retrospective study included 29 definite MD patients who underwent a 4-h delayed intravenous (IV) Gd-enhanced 3D-TSE FLAIR and 3D-SPACE FLAIR MRI between February 2019 and February 2020. MR images were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed twice by 2 experienced head and neck radiologists. Qualitative assessment included grading of cochlear and vestibular EH and visual comparison of PE. Quantitative assessment of PE was performed by placing a region of interest (ROI) and ratio calculation in the basal turn of the cochlea and the brainstem.
The intra- and inter-reader reliability for grading of EH and PE was excellent (0.7 < kappa < 0.9) for 3D-SPACE FLAIR and exceeded the values for 3D-TSE FLAIR (0.5 < kappa < 0.9) The combination of EH and visual assessment of PE has the highest diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing definite MD on 3D-SPACE FLAIR with a sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 0.98 resulting in a sensitivity raise of 6% compared to 3D-TSE FLAIR.
Four-hour delayed IV Gd-enhanced 3D-SPACE FLAIR sequence has a higher sensitivity and reproducibility than 3D-TSE FLAIR for the visualization of EH and increased PE in definite MD patients.

Pathogenesis and Etiology of Ménière Disease: A Scoping Review of a Century of Evidence.
Ménière disease is a rare chronic benign disorder of the inner ear with a natural history of multiple clinical phenotypes of variable severity and a tendency to burnout with time. Although multiple treatment modalities have been shown to improve the disease process-some adversely affecting cochleovestibular function-it remains uncertain whether one, several separate, or a combination of pathophysiologic mechanisms affect the disease process. A scoping review of the evidence underlying proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms of Ménière disease is needed to determine which processes are most likely to be etiopathogenic factors.
Of the 4602 relevant articles found through Embase, Ovid, and PubMed, 444 met inclusion criteria. The most common reported causes of Ménière disease were autoimmune or immune-mediated, genetic, or structural dysfunction of the inner ear. During the study period from inception to March 2021, etiologic theories shifted from structural dysfunction to autoimmune and genetic causes of Ménière disease.
This scoping review found that Ménière disease is a multifactorial disease with lifelong comorbidities and loss of quality-associated life-years whose most commonly reported causes were structural dysfunction, immunologic damage, and genetic susceptibility. Recent studies have examined how autoinflammatory processes and vestibular migraine may be associated with Ménière disease. Large heterogeneity among studies may be explained by historical differences in the clinical understanding of the disease, as well as evolving intervention methodologies and practitioner expertise. Ménière disease is a multifactorial disease with lifelong comorbidities and loss of quality-associated life-years; therefore, future studies of reliable biomarkers of endolymphatic hydrops and real-time imaging are warranted to improve understanding and treatment.

Occlusal splint therapy in patients with Ménière's disease and temporomandibular joint disorder.
This retrospective study aimed to verify the outcomes of stabilising occlusal splint therapy prescribed to 22 patients with unilateral definite Ménière's disease and comorbid temporomandibular joint disorder.
The results of a battery of audiometric and vestibular tests were recorded before and after 6 months of treatment, as well as the scores of disease-specific questionnaires.
The average hearing threshold in the affected ear and the acoustic immittance were unchanged. No spontaneous and positional nystagmus were recorded. Caloric hypo-responsiveness and vestibular myogenic evoked responses did not vary. No changes of stabilometric body sway parameters in eyes opened condition and with optokinetic stimulation delivered to the unaffected labyrinth were observed. A significant reduction was recorded in eyes closed condition and with the optokinetic stimulation toward the affected ear. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, the Situational Vertigo Questionnaire and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale scores improved. The number of vertigo attacks was reduced.
Occlusal splint therapy is a favourable option to reduce aural symptoms of Ménière's disease and comorbid temporomandibular joint disorder, even if its pathophysiological mechanism remains elusive.

Cytokines and Inflammation in Meniere Disease.
Meniere disease (MD) is a rare set of conditions associated with the accumulation of endolymph in the cochlear duct and the vestibular labyrinth with a decrease of endocochlear potential. It is considered a chronic inflammatory disorder of the inner ear with a multifactorial origin. The clinical syndrome includes several groups of patients with a core phenotype: sensorineural hearing loss, episodes of vertigo, and tinnitus with a non-predictable course. Genetic factors and the innate immune response seem to play a central role in the pathophysiology of the condition. Autoimmune MD should be diagnosed if a patient fulfills the diagnostic criteria for MD and one of the following autoimmune disorders: autoimmune thyroid disease, psoriasis, autoimmune arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. We summarize the evidence to support autoimmune MD as an endophenotype in bilateral MD associated with the allelic variant rs4947296 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-mediated inflammation, the role of cytokines (particularly interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) in defining a subset of patients with autoinflammation, and the potential role of cytokines as biomarkers to distinguish between patients with MD and vestibular migraine. Finally, we also introduce a list of potential drugs that could regulate the immune response in MD with potential for repurposing in clinical trials.

Low-salt diet increases mRNA expression of aldosterone-regulated transporters in the intermediate portion of the endolymphatic sac.
The endolymphatic sac is a small sac-shaped organ at the end of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear. The endolymphatic sac absorbs the endolymph, in which the ion balance is crucial for inner ear homeostasis. Of the three sections of the endolymphatic sac, the intermediate portion is the center of endolymph absorption, particularly sodium transport, and is thought to be regulated by aldosterone. Disorders of the endolymphatic sac may cause an excess of endolymph (endolymphatic hydrops), a histological observation in Meniere's disease. A low-salt diet is an effective treatment for Meniere's disease, and is based on the assumption that the absorption of endolymph in the endolymphatic sac abates endolymphatic hydrops through a physiological increase in aldosterone level. However, the molecular basis of endolymph absorption in each portion of the endolymphatic sac is largely unknown because of difficulties in gene expression analysis, resulting from its small size and intricate structure. The present study combined reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and laser capture microdissection techniques to analyze the difference of gene expression of the aldosterone-controlled epithelial Na
+
 channel, thiazide-sensitive Na
+
-Cl
-
 cotransporter, and Na
+
, K
+
-ATPase genes in the three individual portions of the endolymphatic sac in a rat model. A low-salt diet increased the expression of aldosterone-controlled ion transporters, particularly in the intermediate portion of the endolymphatic sac. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of the physiological function of the endolymphatic sac and the pathophysiology of Meniere's disease.

Imaging Analysis of Patients With Meniere's Disease Treated With Endolymphatic Sac-Mastoid Shunt Surgery.
Objective:
 Endolymphatic sac surgery is effective in treating intractable Meniere's disease (MD), but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Our study investigated the mechanism by which endolymphatic sac-mastoid shunt (EMS) surgery is effective in treating MD by means of imaging. 
Methods:
 The experiment included 19 patients with intractable MD who underwent 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI with a 3-Tesla unit 6 h after intravenous administration of gadolinium, before EMS, and 2 years after the surgery. The enhanced perilymphatic space in the bilateral cochlea, vestibule, and canals was visualized and compared with that in the endolymphatic space by quantitatively scoring the scala vestibuli of the cochlea and by measuring the developing area of the vestibules quantitatively. 
Results:
 Gadolinium was present in the perilymph of the inner ear in the cochlea, vestibules, and canals of all patients. At the 2-year follow-up, 14 (73.68%) patients had vertigo control. Both before and 2 years after surgery, significant differences were observed in the scala vestibuli scores and the area of vestibular perilymph between the affected and healthy sides. The scala vestibuli scores and the area of vestibular perilymph, however, did not differ when comparing them before and after surgery. 
Conclusions:
 According to our results, endolymphatic hydrops was not significantly reduced by surgery. The mechanism by which EMS controls vertigo might be unrelated to the improvement in hydrops.

A Portrait of Menière's Disease Using Contemporary Hearing and Balance Tests.
Menière's disease (MD) is characterized by recurrent vertigo and fluctuating aural symptoms. Diagnosis is straightforward in typical presentations, but a proportion of patients present with atypical symptoms. Our aim is to profile the array of symptoms patients may initially present with and to analyze the vestibular and audiological test results of patients with a diagnosis of MD.
A retrospective study of patient files.
A tertiary, neuro-otology clinic Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.
We identified 375 patients. Their history, examination, vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), video head-impulse test, canal-paresis on caloric testing, subjective visual horizontal (SVH), electrocochleography, ictal nystagmus, and audiometry were assessed.
Atypical presenting symptoms were disequilibrium (n = 49), imbalance (n = 13), drop-attacks (n = 12), rocking vertigo (n = 2), and unexplained vomiting (n = 3), nonspontaneous vestibular symptoms in 21.6%, fluctuation of aural symptoms only (46%), and headaches (31.2%). Low velocity, interictal spontaneous-nystagmus in 13.3% and persistent positional-nystagmus in 12.5%. Nystagmus recorded ictally in 90 patients was mostly horizontal (93%) and of high velocity (48 ± 34°/s). Testing yielded abnormal caloric responses in 69.6% and abnormal video head impulse test 12.7%. Air-conducted cervical VEMPs were abnormal in 32.2% (mean asymmetry ratio [AR] 30.2 ± 46.5%) and bone-conducted ocular VEMPs abnormal in 8.8% (AR 11.2 ± 26.8%). Abnormal interictal SVH was in 30.6%, (ipsiversive n = 46 and contraversive n = 19). Mean pure-tone averages 50 dB ± 23.5 and 20 dB ± 13 for affected and unaffected ears.
Menière's disease has a distinctive history, but atypical presentations with normal vestibular function and hearing are a diagnostic challenge delaying treatment initiation.

Meniere disease subtyping: the direction of diagnosis and treatment in the future.
Meniere's disease (MD) is a chronic disorder of inner ear, characterized by audial and vestibular symptoms. It presents a great variability among patients in terms of clinical features, etiology, pathology, and response to the same therapy. It's challenging to diagnose and manage for its heterogeneity. Indeed, the consensus is reached that MD has subtypes. Identifying subtypes of MD is important for individualized therapy and further research.
In this review, we examined the heterogeneity of MD. We also included the valid subtyping solutions and updated data regarding the association among subtypes, disease progression, and management.
MD is an etiologically multifactorial condition, and it might be a constellation of symptoms associated with endolymph hydrops, not a disease entity. So far, MD can be classified as distinct phenotypes and endotype, respectively based on symptoms, pathology, possible etiology, and co-existing condition. Patients in different subtypes present different clinical features and are suitable for different treatment. The identification of these subtypes will benefit both basic and clinical studies of MD, by helping achieve personalized therapy, accurate prognosis prediction and even disease screening in near future. Therefore, MD subtyping is the emerging direction of diagnosis and treatment in the future.

Bidirectional Transport of IgE by CD23 in the Inner Ear of Patients with Meniere's Disease.
Meniere's disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear characterized by episodes of spontaneous vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and tinnitus. Recent studies have demonstrated that IgE may play a role in the pathogenesis of MD. Patients with MD (
n
 = 103), acoustic neuroma (
n
 = 5), and healthy subjects (
n
 = 72) were recruited into the study. Serum from the participants was analyzed for IgE and type 2-related cytokines. IgE and CD23 expression levels in vestibular end organs of patients, C57BL/6 mice, or mouse HEI-OC1 cells were analyzed. Finally, the role of CD23 in IgE transcytosis was assessed using HEI-OC1 cells. Serum IgE was elevated in patients with MD and positively correlated with clinical symptoms. IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and CD23 levels were increased in patients with MD compared with the control group. In the transcytosis assay, mouse IgE was found to be bidirectionally transported across the HEI-OC1 cell monolayer. Additionally, CD23 downregulation using a small interfering RNA approach significantly reduced the efficiency of IgE transcytosis, suggesting that IgE is transported by CD23. Furthermore, exposure to IL-4 increased CD23 expression and enhanced IgE transcytosis in the HEI-OC1 cells and primary vestibular end organs. Our study indicated that IgE may play a role in the pathophysiology of MD. In addition, CD23-mediated IgE transcytosis in the hair cells may play a critical role in initiating inflammation in the inner ear. Thus, reducing the level of IgE may be a potentially effective approach for MD treatment.

Inner ear MRI enhancement based on three dimensional-real IR sequence in patients with Meniere's disease after intravenous gadolinium injection: Comparison of different doses used and exploration of an appropriate dose.
Three-dimensional inversion-recovery sequence with real reconstruction (3D-real IR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect endolymphatic hydrops of the inner ear. We aimed to explore a appropriate dose for intravenous gadolinium injection.
Observational prospective study.
Tertiary referral centre.
We collected 90 unilateral definite Meniere's disease patients.
All enrolled patients were divided into three groups randomly (patients in group A, B and C received gadolinium injection in 1/1.5/2 times doses respectively). After 4 h, inner ear MRI scans were applied.
The signal intensities of B-affected ears and C-affected ears were significantly higher than A-affected ears (p < .05); however, no difference was found between B-affected ears and C-affected ears (p = .267). The same conditions also appeared in the three unaffected-ear groups. Moreover, the signal intensities of affected-ear in group A, B and C were significantly higher than that of the corresponding unaffected-ear groups (p < .05). Besides, the subjective visual evaluation scores of group B and C were significantly better than that of group A (p < .05).
Intravenous injection of gadolinium in a single dose may be unbefitting for the inner ear imaging based on 3D-real IR MRI, both the applications of gadolinium in 1.5 times and double doses can have a good perilymphatic enhancement effect of inner ear. In order to minimise the use of dose for avoiding or mitigating the adverse reactions and renal damage, 1.5 times dose may be preferred in clinical practice.

Retrosigmoid Vestibular Neurectomy for Meniere Disease: A Technical Note.
Meniere disease (MD) is an idiopathic peripheral pathology involving the acoustic apparatus. One of the most critical challenges in managing MD is intractable vertigo. In this context, retrosigmoid vestibular neurectomy has been described as a safe and effective technique to manage this symptom when it is resistant to first- and second-line treatments. This article analyzed the alternative treatment options, specific surgical anatomy, and relevant details of vestibular neurectomies performed for intractable MD.
Relevant neurovascular landmarks, critical surgical steps, adequate indications, and potential pitfalls of retrosigmoid vestibular neurectomy were analyzed based on an illustrative clinical case of intractable MD.
The illustrative case demonstrated how early recognition of the facial nerve and the vestibulocochlear plane is fundamental to performing retrosigmoid vestibular neurectomy. This procedure is indicated in cases of resistant MD with preoperative hearing integrity. Potential pitfalls of this technique are incomplete neurotomy, nerve regeneration, comorbidities in the contralateral ear, adverse anatomy, the possibility of nonotologic vertigo, and incomplete vestibular compensation.
Vestibular neurectomy represents a safe and effective technique to manage MD that is resistant to medical treatment, allowing symptom control and hearing preservation. Nevertheless, detailed knowledge of surgical anatomy and possible pitfalls is of paramount importance to achieve a good outcome.

Transcanal Transvestibular Endoscopic Neurectomy: First Experience.
Ménière's disease is an idiopathic inner ear disorder characterized by recurrent vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and persistent tinnitus. In 10% to 30% of cases, conservative therapy fails, and Ménière's disease is defined as intractable. In these patients, ablative techniques with unilateral vestibular deafferentation are mandatory. Several approaches for vestibular neurectomy, which preserve hearing capability, are described. In patients presenting severe dizziness associated with high-grade sensorineural hearing loss, surgical labyrinthectomy, or selected vestibular neurectomy through a translabyrinthine approach are the treatments commonly considered. This study reports the first application of transcanal transvestibular endoscopic neurectomy in two patients with frequent disabling vertigo and high-grade sensorineural hypoacusia.
This was a retrospective chart review including patients with intractable Ménière's disease who underwent vestibular neurectomy, performed in our ENT department between January 2017 and January 2020, selecting patients with disabling vertigo and high-grade sensorineural hypoacusia. We describe step-by-step the surgical technique of transcanal transvestibular endoscopic neurectomy.
Overall, two patients underwent transcanal transvestibular endoscopic neurectomy. We performed transcanal transvestibular neurectomy in all cases. No intraoperative complications were observed. On the 2nd postoperative day, one patient presented CSF leak, leading to surgical revision. A complete resolution of vertigo attacks was observed 6 months after surgery.
Even though this study presents a limited number of cases, transcanal transvestibular neurectomy is a promising, safe, and effective procedure in selected cases.

Update on diagnosis and differential diagnosis of vestibular migraine.
Vestibular migraine (VM) is considered the most common cause of spontaneous episodic vertigo and the second most common cause of vertigo. However, without a biomarker or a complete understanding of the pathophysiology, VM remains underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Therefore, definite diagnostic criteria are urgently needed. Meanwhile, VM should be clearly differentiated from other similar diseases. This paper may help clinicians improve the diagnostic rate of VM and reduce the rate of misdiagnosis. A PubMed search was performed using the following terms: vestibular migraine, migraine-associated vertigo/dizziness, migraine-related vertigo, migraine-related vestibulopathy, benign recurrent vertigo, vertiginous migraine, migraine, headache, vertigo, dizziness, and diagnosis. This paper also summarizes the diagnostic criteria and differential diagnoses of VM. The diagnosis of VM is based on the symptoms, degree, frequency, and duration of the vestibular episodes, a history of migraine, and the temporal association of migraine symptoms with vestibular episodes in at least 50% of cases, while ruling out what may be due to other reasons. In addition to vestibular symptoms and migraine, transient auditory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, and susceptibility to motion sickness may also be associated with VM. Thus, VM should be differentiated from other diseases such as Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, migraine with brainstem aura, vestibular neuritis, posterior circulation ischemia, multiple lacunar infarction, vestibular paroxysmia, motion sickness, and episodic ataxia type 2.
Only if the diagnostic criteria of VM and differential diagnosis can be mastered clearly, we can make a definite diagnosis and treat patients properly.

A Historical Perspective on Surgical Manipulation of the Membranous Labyrinth for Treatment of Meniere's Disease.
Meniere's disease is an inner ear disorder without a known cause. Endolymphatic hydrops is a swelling of the endolymph spaces that has been observed consistently on post-mortem histology in patients with a history of Meniere's disease but can occur in asymptomatic individuals and in association with other diseases. Since its discovery, Meniere's disease has been a disorder managed primarily by otolaryngologists. Surgical treatments, therefore, have accompanied attempts at medical management. Inspired by patients' sensations of ear fullness and later by the histologic findings of hydrops, surgeons began manipulating the membranous labyrinth to relieve episodes of vertigo while attempting to preserve hearing. This review highlights this history of manipulation of the membranous labyrinth. These procedures indicate a rich history of innovation that parallels developments in otologic surgery. The studies involving patients are uniformly retrospective, with some procedures performed first in animal models of endolymphatic hydrops. Many approaches were endorsed by eminent otologic surgeons. Surgeries on the endolymphatic sac are performed by some surgeons today; however, procedures on the membranous labyrinth resulted in similar symptomatic relief through a minimally invasive technique, in many cases performed using only local anesthetic. Episodic vertigo in patients with Meniere's disease is a distressing symptom, yet spontaneous remissions are common. The reports of procedures on the membranous labyrinth reviewed here consistently indicated fewer vertigo episodes. Variable degrees of hearing loss were common following these procedures, and many were abandoned. Additional innovative surgeries are inevitable, but we must understand better the relationships among endolymphatic hydrops, Meniere's disease pathophysiology, and patient symptoms.

Case Report: Preservation of Otolithic Function After Triple Semicircular Canal Occlusion in a Patient With Intractable Ménière Disease.
Operative measures are considered when medical treatment fails to control vertigo in patients with intractable Ménière disease. The present report discusses a case in which triple semicircular canal occlusion was performed in a 30-year-old female patient who responded poorly to previously performed endolymphatic sac surgery. Her vestibular and auditory functions were evaluated both before and after surgery. Class A control of vertigo was achieved during the 76-month postoperative follow-up period. Ocular and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials could be elicited before and after surgery. This case suggests that relatively long-term preservation of otolithic function can be achieved following triple semicircular canal occlusion, highlighting its potential as an alternative treatment for patients with Ménière disease.

Anatomical variation of inner ear may be a predisposing factor for unilateral Ménière's disease rather than for ipsilateral delayed endolymphatic hydrops.
Radiological anatomical variations, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were evaluated in patients with ipsilateral delayed endolymphatic hydrops (DEH) and unilateral Ménière's disease (MD). The role of anatomical variations in different subtypes of hydropic ear disease was investigated.
Twenty-eight patients with ipsilateral DEH, 76 patients with unilateral MD, and 59 control subjects were enrolled. The radiological indices included the distance between the vertical part of the posterior semicircular canal and the posterior fossa (MRI-PP distance) and the visibility of vestibular aqueduct (MRI-VA). These variations among patients with DEH, MD, and control subjects were compared. The correlation between radiological anatomical variations and clinical features or audio-vestibular findings was also examined.
(1) MRI-PP distance in the affected side of unilateral MD was shorter than that in ipsilateral DEH (Z =  - 2.481, p = 0.013) and control subjects (Z =  - 2.983, p = 0.003), while the difference of MRI-PP distance between the affected side of ipsilateral DEH and control subjects was not statistically significant (Z =  - 0.859, p = 0.391). (2) There was no significant interaural difference of MRI-PP distance in patients with unilateral MD (Z =  - 0.041, p = 0.968) and ipsilateral DEH (t =  - 0.107, p = 0.915) respectively. (3) No significant interaural difference of MRI-VA visibility was observed in patients with unilateral MD (χ
2
 = 0.742, p = 0.389) and ipsilateral DEH (χ
2
 = 0.327, p = 0.567) respectively. (4) No correlation was found between these anatomical variables and clinical features or audio-vestibular findings in patients with unilateral MD and ipsilateral DEH respectively (p > 0.05).
Anatomical variations of inner ear may be a predisposing factor in the pathogenesis of unilateral MD rather than ipsilateral DEH.
• Patients with ipsilateral delayed endolymphatic hydrops showed normal distance between the vertical part of the posterior semicircular canal and the posterior fossa. • Compared to patients with ipsilateral delayed endolymphatic hydrops and control subjects, patients with unilateral Ménière's disease exhibited shorter distance between the vertical part of the posterior semicircular canal and the posterior fossa. • Anatomical variations of inner ear may be a predisposing factor in the pathogenesis of unilateral Ménière's disease rather than ipsilateral delayed endolymphatic hydrops.

Screening for Eustachian Tube Dysfunction in Clinical Practice Using the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7.
To evaluate the ability of the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7 (ETDQ-7) to discriminate between patients with Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and Non-ETD diagnoses, and identify symptom information to improve ability to discriminate these groups.
Cohort study.
Pilot retrospective study with consecutive adult patients presenting to otology clinics and one general otolaryngology clinic in an academic health system. Patients were administered ETDQ-7 with eight additional symptom items. Electronic health records were reviewed for demographic and diagnostic information. Patients were grouped into diagnosis categories: 1) True ETD, 2) experiencing ear fullness (EF) not due to ETD, and 3) Control patients without ETD-related disorders or EF. ETDQ-7 and symptom item scores were compared by the diagnosis group. Receiver-operative characteristics curves and area under the curve (AUC) were generated for each ETD diagnosis group based on ETDQ-7 and symptom scores.
Of the 108 patients included in this study 74 (68.5%) were diagnosed with ETD. Patients with ETD had higher (indicating worse symptom burden) overall ETDQ-7 scores than Control group (Median [Q1, Q3] 3.0, [1.7, 4.1]; versus 1.5 [1.0, 3.4] P = .008). There was no statistically significant difference between overall ETDQ-7 scores for ETD and Non-ETD EF patients (P = .389). The AUC for the ETDQ-7 in discriminating ETD from other conditions that cause EF was 0.569; the addition of 8 symptom questions to the ETDQ-7 improved AUC to 0.801.
Additional patient-reported symptom information may improve the ability to discriminate ETD from other similarly presenting diagnoses when using ETDQ-7.

A case report on probable short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing following vairechanika nasya in Ménière's disease.
A 62 year old woman diagnosed with Ménière's disease, who underwent vairechanika nasya (VN) with shadbindu taila presented with short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) like phenomena immediately after the procedure. Rescue measures of abhyanga (local oil massage) and nadi sweda (local fomentation) were administered. Within half an hour the symptoms considerably declined and after 1 hour got completely relieved. The exact symptom disclosure by the patient who herself was a doctor helped in detecting the classic pattern of 'saw tooth phenomena' giving leads into a rare manifestation of probable SUNCT. Naranjo scale yielded zero score and thus the probable causality of VN with shadbindu taila could not be established so as to cause probable SUNCT as an adverse drug reaction (ADR). This case study is not put up for reporting an ADR of VN with shadbindu taila; rather this illustrates an uncommon, yet imperative adverse event of probable SUNCT while undergoing nasya procedure probably due to judgment error while fixing the VN dose in a patient with Ménière's disease. Transparent reporting of such unusual events during panchakarma procedures is necessary so that clinicians can understand, evaluate and take appropriate initiatives to manage them.

Enhanced Eye Velocity With Backup Saccades in vHIT Tests of a Menière Disease Patient: A Case Report.
Reduced eye velocity and overt or covert compensatory saccades during horizontal head impulse testing are the signs of reduced vestibular function. However, here we report the unusual case of a patient who had enhanced eye velocity during horizontal head impulses followed by a corrective saccade. We term this saccade a "backup saccade" because it acts to compensate for the gaze position error caused by the enhanced velocity (and enhanced VOR gain) and acts to return gaze directly to the fixation target as shown by eye position records. We distinguish backup saccades from overt or covert compensatory saccades or the anticompensatory quick eye movement (ACQEM) of Heuberger et al. (1) ACQEMs are anticompensatory in that they are in the same direction as head velocity and so, act to take gaze off the target and thus require later compensatory (overt) saccades to return gaze to the target. Neither of these responses were found in this patient. The patient here was diagnosed with unilateral definite Meniere's disease (MD) on the right and had enhanced VOR (gain of 1.17) for rightward head impulses followed by backup saccades. For leftwards head impulses eye velocity and VOR gain were in the normal range (VOR gain of 0.89). As further confirmation, testing with 1.84 Hz horizontal sinusoidal head movements in the visual-vestibular (VVOR) paradigm also showed these backup saccades for rightwards head turns but normal slow phase eye velocity responses without backup saccades for leftwards had turns. This evidence shows that backup saccades can be observed in some MD patients who show enhanced eye velocity responses during vHIT and that these backup saccades act to correct for gaze position error caused by the enhanced eye velocity during the head impulse and so have a compensatory effect on gaze stabilization.

Efficacy and Durability of Intratympanic Gentamicin Treatment for Meniere's Disease.
Objective:
 To study the success of intratympanic gentamicin (ITG) treatment in reducing vertigo attacks in Meniere's disease (MD) and the value of the Halmagyi head thrust test (HTT) in predicting treatment durability. 
Study Design:
 Retrospective cohort study. 
Setting:
 Tertiary care vestibular clinic. 
Patients:
 Unilateral MD patients treated with ITG from 2006-2019 with ≥6 months follow-up. 
Main Outcome Measures:
 Demographics, audiometric data, subjective symptomatology, and HTT results were collected. Treatment success was defined as sufficient symptom relief. Treatment failure indicated vertigo control of less than 6 months duration. Treatment relapse indicated vertigo recurrence after 6 months. 
Results:
 Of 255 patients, treatment success, failure, and relapse occurred in 226 (88.6%), 29 (11.4%), and 121 (47.1%) patients, respectively. 48 (18.8%) patients who failed to respond or relapsed underwent labyrinthectomy. Mean follow-up time was 3.7 yrs (range 0.5-12.8). After ITG treatment, 25% patients reported worse hearing; mean pure tone average (PTA) increased by 18.6 ± 11.3 dB and mean word recognition score (WRS) decreased by 33 ± 21%. Of the 148 patients with negative pre-treatment HHT, 103 (69.6%) converted to positive after ITG treatment. Mean time-to-relapse in the converted and non-converted HTT cohorts was significantly different (49.7 vs. 27.0 months, 
p
 = 0.009) even after adjusting for gender, age, laterality, duration of symptoms, and number of ITG treatments. There were no significant differences between the two groups in hearing outcomes or subjective symptoms (e.g. lingering disequilibrium). 
Conclusions:
 ITG treatment effectively reduces the number of vertigo attacks in MD. HTT is valuable in predicting durability of treatment benefit.

Changes in endolymphatic hydrops after vestibular neurectomy observed in magnetic resonance imaging - A pilot study.
The aim was to evaluate endolymphatic hydrops in patients with Ménière's disease before and after vestibular neurectomy to verify if the endolymphatic space dilatation, observed in magnetic resonance imaging, regressed within several months after surgery.
Magnetic resonance imaging was performed after intravenous gadolinium injection in four patients with unilateral definite Ménière's disease before and eight months after vestibular neurectomy. Clinical symptoms, audiovestibular tests, and endolymphatic hydrops in magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated.
Endolymphatic hydrops was visualized in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in three out of four analyzed patients. In the remaining one, an asymmetrical contrast enhancement in the affected ear was found. After the vestibular neurectomy, all four patients presented a complete resolution of vertigo episodes and improved functional level. Significant postoperative hearing deterioration was found in two patients. In the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, no reduction of the endolymphatic hydrops was visualized. A reduction of asymmetrical contrast enhancement in one patient was found.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the inner ear is a helpful diagnostic tool for Menière's disease. Vestibular neurectomy is an effective treatment for intractable vertigo; however, there is no endolymphatic hydrops regression evidence within several months after the surgery. Therefore, further studies with a long follow-up period and repeated magnetic resonance imaging are needed to assess the vestibular neurectomy's impact on endolymphatic hydrops. Nevertheless, magnetic resonance imaging supports the clinical diagnosis of Ménière's disease and may help understand its pathophysiology.

A comparison of endolymphatic duct blockage, endolymphatic sac drainage and endolymphatic sac decompression surgery in reversing endolymphatic hydrops in Meniere's disease.
To explore the differences between endolymphatic duct blockage, endolymphatic sac drainage and endolymphatic sac decompression surgery in the reversal of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in patients with intractable Meniere's disease (MD).
A total of 27 MD patients receiving endolymphatic duct blockage surgery (n = 10), endolymphatic sac drainage surgery (n = 9) and endolymphatic sac decompression surgery (n = 8) underwent gadolinium-enhanced inner ear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans prior to, 2 weeks after and at > 12 months following surgery.
In the group with endolymphatic duct blockage, the second MRI revealed no changes in EH, whereas the third MRI revealed a reversal of vestibular EH in 3 patients and a downgrading of cochlear hydrops in 2 of these 3 patients, who presented with an improvement in their hearing and complete control of vertigo. In the group with endolymphatic sac drainage, the second MRI showed a reversal of EH in 4 patients, and no changes in EH in the remaining 5 patients, whereas the third MRI showed that those 4 patients who presented with a reversal of EH at the second MRI stage remained unchanged except a recurrence of vestibular hydrops in 1 patient. All 4 patients exhibited a complete control of vertigo, but hearing improved in 1, worsened in 1 and remained unchanged in 2. In the group with endolymphatic sac decompression, both the second and third MRI examination revealed no reversal of EH.
The present study has shown that both endolymphatic duct blockage surgery and endolymphatic sac drainage surgery have the potential to reduce EH in certain MD patients, but none of the patients receiving endolymphatic sac decompression surgery showed reversal of their EH.

Visualization of the saccule and utricle with non-contrast-enhanced FLAIR sequences.
3D-fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) collected 4 h after intravenous gadolinium injection can delineate the perilymphatic space (PLS) from the endolymphatic space (ELS) to capture endolymphatic hydrops, the pathological counterpart of Ménière's disease. We aimed to optimize visualization of such inner ear internal anatomy using 3D-FLAIR without injection.
3D-FLAIR signal from different fluid compartments such as PLS and ELS was first simulated. Then, twenty-two healthy subjects were scanned at 3.0-T MRI with non-injected 3D-FLAIR using variable T2 preparations (T2Preps) (OFF, 200, 400, and 600 ms) and variable inversion times (TIs) (from 224 to 5000 ms) and different resolutions (1.0 × 1.0 × 1.5, 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.8, and 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 mm
3
). The relative contrast between PLS and ELS and the visibility of the saccule and utricle were assessed. Additionally, non-injected 3D-FLAIR with the optimal setting was tested in a Ménière patient and compared with gadolinium-injected 3D-FLAIR.
The PLS and ELS were differentiated when T2Prep was used but not without. The relative contrast was larger with T2Prep at 400 ms than at 200 or 600 ms (0.72 ± 0.22 vs. 0.44 ± 0.11, p = 0.019; and 0.72 ± 0.22 vs. 0.46 ± 0.28, p = 0.034, respectively). The saccule and utricle were best delineated in 87. % cases with T2Prep = 400 and TI = 2100 ms at the highest resolution. Visualization of the saccule and utricle in the optimized non-injected 3D-FLAIR was similar to conventional injected 3D-FLAIR in a patient.
Combining a specific T2Prep and TI in non-injected 3D-FLAIR could separate PLS and ELS and even the saccule and utricle, paving the way toward future application to diagnose Ménière's disease.
• MRI can capture the internal anatomy of inner ear without injection of contrast media. • Specific parameters consisting of a T2 preparation of 400 ms and an inversion time of 2100 ms must be used to visualize the saccule and utricle on non-injected 3D-FLAIR.

Association of Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Gene Polymorphism with Meniere's Disease in an Iranian Sample.
Meniere's disease (MD) is known as a rare chronic disorder of the inner ear with elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, Interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6. This study aims to evaluate genes polymorphism in some pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in a group of Iranian MD patients compared to the healthy controls. In this case-control study, 25 MD patients and 139 healthy controls were enrolled. DNA was extracted from blood samples, and single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers assay. MD patients and controls were examined in terms of allele, genotype, and haplotype frequency of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Only the frequencies of alleles A/G at position -238 in the promoter of the TNF-α gene differed significantly between MD patients and healthy controls. G to A allele ratio was 23 and 3.6 in MD and controls, respectively. In individuals with MD, genotype GG was found to be significantly more prevalent at position -238 of the TNF-α gene promoter sequence. In addition, the heterozygote AG variant of -238 A/G TNF-α gene polymorphism was lower in MD patients than controls. Compared to the control group, the haplotype TNF- (-308, -238) AG was higher in MD patients, although not statistically significant. This is the first study that we know of that evaluates the frequencies of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in an Iranian MD sample. This study shows the association between TNF-α and susceptibility to MD.

[Study on the relationship between the morphology of the isthmus of the vestibular aqueduct and Meniere's disease based on 10 μm otology CT].
Objective:
 To evaluate the morphology of isthmus of the vestibular aqueduct (VA) and its relationship with the occurrence, course of Meniere's disease (MD) and the degree of hearing loss based on 10 μm otology CT. 
Methods:
 A total of 13 patients with MD in Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2020 to July 2021, including 4 males and 9 females, age from 16 to 77 (56±16) years, were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent 10 μm otology CT examination. The included lesion side was the MD affected group (14 sides), and the non-lesion side was the MD healthy group (12 sides). According to the 1∶2 side, 16 sex-and side matched cases (28 sides) without external and middle ear disease were included in the control group, including 4 males and 12 females, age from 16 to 77 (56±14) years. The horizontal semicircular canal showed on the largest plane was considered as the standard cross-section, and continuous observation was made on this image. According to the display type of isthmus of the VA, it was divided into Ⅰ to Ⅳ grades. Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare the morphological differences of VA isthmus among the affected group, the healthy group and the control group. The degree of hearing impairment was assessed by pure tone audiometry (PTA) results, which were divided into normal/mild/moderate/moderately severe/severe/extremely severe hearing impairment. Spearman correlation analysis was used to compare the correlation between the morphological rating of VA isthmus on the affected side and age, course of disease and the results of pure tone audiometry (PTA). 
Results:
 The proportions of VA isthmic morphology GRADE Ⅰ,Ⅱ,Ⅲ,Ⅳ in the MD affected group were 28.6% (4/14), 42.9% (6/14), 21.4% (3/14), 7.1% (1/14), those in the MD healthy group were 0 (0/12), 33.3% (4/12), 33.3% (4/12), 33.3% (4/12), and those in the control group were 0 (0/28), 7.1% (2/28), 64.2% (18/28), 28.6% (8/28). The VA isthmus scores [
M
 (
Q1, Q3
)] of MD affected group was lower than that of MD healthy group [2 (1, 3) vs 3 (2, 4)] and control group [2 (1, 3) vs 3 (3, 4)] (all 
P
<0.05, respectively). The morphology of the VA isthmus on the affected side of MD was negatively correlated with age (
r
=-0.81, 
P
=0.002), and there was no correlation with the course of disease and degree of hearing impairment (
r
=-0.40, 
r
=-0.26; all 
P
>0.05, respectively). 
Conclusion:
 The stenosis of the VA isthmus in MD was a possible anatomical factor for the occurrence of MD

Increased Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 Accompanying Pro-Inflammatory Processes are Associated with Progressive Hearing Impairment and Bilateral Disability of Meniere's Disease.
The progression of hearing impairment and the bilateral involvement of Meniere's disease (MD) may depend on the disease duration and aging. Recent studies reported that MD might involve dysfunction of the microvascular circulation damaged due to inflammatory changes.
The aim of this study was to determine that the progress of the MD's hearing impairment and bilateral disability may be associated with the pathogenesis of several pro-inflammatory processes.
We recruited 30 unilateral MD patients (56.8 ± 14.7 years old), 7 bilateral MD patients (65.3 ± 13.9 years old), and 17 age-matched control subjects (53.5 ± 14.4 years old, p > 0.05). We measured the plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasma tumor-necrosis factor α (TNFα), and plasma monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1).
The bilateral MD group and the unilateral MD group had higher plasma MCP-1 (204.7 ± 41.0 pg/mL and 169.5 ± 32.0 pg/mL) than the control group (149.2 ± 30.7 pg/mL) (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in plasma TNFα, IL-6, and VEGF among 3 groups (p > 0.05). There was a strong correlation between the plasma MCP-1 and age in MD patients (r = 0.58, p < 0.01); however, no significant correlation between the plasma MCP-1 and age was found in control subjects (p > 0.05). The plasma MCP-1 significantly correlated with the average hearing level of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz, and the maximum slow phase eye velocity in caloric test in the better side (p < 0.05). Also, the plasma MCP-1 showed significant positive correlations with the plasma IL-6 (r = 0.49, p < 0.01) and plasma TNFα (r = 0.32, p < 0.05) in MD group.
Our results suggest that the increased plasma MCP-1 accompanying pro-inflammatory processes are associated with the progression of the hearing impairment and the bilateral disability of MD.

The DizzyQuest: relation between self-reported hearing loss, tinnitus and objective hearing thresholds in patients with Meniere's disease.
Combining a mobile application-based vestibular diary called the DizzyQuest and an iPad-based hearing test enables evaluation of the relationship between experienced neuro-otological symptoms and hearing thresholds in daily life setting. The aim was to investigate the relationship between self-reported hearing symptoms and hearing thresholds in patients with Meniere's disease (MD), using the DizzyQuest and the iPad-based hearing test simultaneously.
The DizzyQuest was administered for 3 weeks in 21 patients. Using the experience-sampling-method (ESM), it assessed hearing loss and tinnitus severity for both ears separately. Each day after the DizzyQuest, an iPad-based hearing test was used to measure hearing thresholds. A mixed model regression analysis was performed to investigate relationships between hearing thresholds and self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus severity.
Fifteen patients were included. Overall, pure-tone averages (PTAs) were not correlated with self-reported hearing loss severity and tinnitus. Individual differences in PTA results between both ears did not significantly influence the difference in self-reported hearing loss severity between both ears. Self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus scores were significantly higher in ears that corresponded with audiometric criteria of MD (p < 0.001). Self-reported tinnitus severity significantly increased with self-reported hearing loss severity in affected (p = 0.011) and unaffected ears (p < 0.001).
Combining the DizzyQuest and iPad-based hearing test, facilitated assessment of self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus severity and their relationship with hearing thresholds, in a daily life setting. This study illustrated the importance of investigating neuro-otological symptoms at an individual level, using multiple measurements. ESM strategies like the DizzyQuest should therefore be considered in neuro-otological research.

Endoscopic Transcanal Labyrinthectomy for Intractable Meniere's Disease: An Alternative to Transmastoid Labyrinthectomy?
To describe a novel approach for intractable Ménière's disease exclusively through a transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) approach.
A 56-year-old male with intractable Ménière's disease despite conservative treatment and chemical labyrinthectomy.
Transcanal endoscopic labyrinthectomy.
Subjective vertigo control, surgical morbidity.
The TEES approach provided a wide exposure of the oval window. This facilitated removal of stapes crura and footplate. After widening of the oval window, the perilymph was suctioned, and gentamicin was injected through the oval window. The oval window was obliterated using the perichondrium of the tragal cartilage and fibrin glue. After 2 years of follow-up, there was no recurrence of vertigo.
As a compelling alternative to the transmastoid approach, we propose endoscopic labyrinthectomy as an option for patients with intractable MD without functional hearing who have failed chemical labyrinthectomy. Additional studies are needed to determine the risk-benefit profile of this technique.

Vestibular function testing in the 21st century: video head impulse test, vestibular evoked myogenic potential, video nystagmography; which tests will provide answers?
To most neurologists, assessing the patient with vertigo is an unpleasant and worrisome task. A structured history and focused examination can be complemented by carefully selected laboratory tests, to reach an early and accurate diagnosis. We provide evidence-based recommendations for vestibular test selection.
The video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) and home-video nystagmography are four modern, noninvasive methods of assessing vestibular function, which are equally applicable in the hospital and office-practice. Collectively, they enable assessment of all five vestibular end-organs. The prevalence and patterns of test abnormalities are distinct for each vestibular disorder. We summarize typical abnormalities encountered in four common vestibular syndromes.
In the context of acute vestibular syndrome, an abnormal vHIT with low gain and large amplitude refixation saccades and an asymmetric oVEMP separates innocuous vestibular neuritis from stroke. In episodic spontaneous vertigo, high-velocity ictal nystagmus and asymmetric cVEMP help separate Ménière's disease from vestibular migraine. In chronic imbalance, all three tests help detect unilateral or bilateral vestibular loss as the root cause. Recurrent positional vertigo requires no laboratory test and can be diagnosed and treated at the bedside, guided by video nystagmography.

[A preliminary study on characteristics of wideband acoustic immittance in patients with Meniere's disease].
Objective:
To explore the wideband absorbance characteristics of patients with Meniere's disease（MD）. 
Methods:
Wideband acoustic immittance was performed in 52 patients with unilateral Meniere's disease（UMD） and 30 control subjects with normal hearing. All UMD patients underwent pure tone audiometry, 226 Hz acoustic immittance, wideband acoustic immittance, and gadolinium contrast MRI. Sixteen frequency points were chosen to analyze the wideband absorbance at ambient and peak pressure, and the subjects were grouped as UMD group vs. control group and asymptomatic group. The student's 
t
-test was used to compare the absorbance difference between them. 
Results:
Both at peak and ambient pressure, there was a significant difference between the MD group and control group at 1587 Hz, 2000 Hz, 2519 Hz, 3174 Hz, and 4000 Hz; the MD group was lower than the control group（
P
<0.05）; there were no differences between the asymptomatic group and the symptomatic group, there also was a significant difference between the asymptomatic group and control group at 1587-4000 Hz（
P
<0.05）. 
Conclusion:
The wideband absorbance in MD patients was significantly reduced within the frequency range of 1587-4000 Hz, and wideband acoustic immittance seems to be cost-effective in predicting MD.

Post-traumatic peripheral vestibular disorders (excluding positional vertigo) in workers following head injury.
Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has typically been reported to be the most common cause of post-traumatic dizziness. There is however paucity in the literature about other peripheral vestibular disorders post-head injury. This article provides an overview of other causes of non-positional dizziness post-head trauma from our large institutional experience. The UHN WSIB Neurotology database (n = 4291) between 1998 and 2018 was retrospectively studied for those head-injured workers presenting with non-positional peripheral vestibular disorders. All subjects had a detailed neurotological history and examination and vestibular testing including video nystagmography, video head impulse testing (or a magnetic scleral search coil study), vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, and audiometry. Imaging studies included routine brain and high-resolution temporal bone CT scans and/or brain MRI. Based on a database of 4291 head-injured workers with dizziness, 244 were diagnosed with non-positional peripheral vertigo. Recurrent vestibulopathy (RV) was the most common cause of non-positional post-traumatic vertigo. The incidence of Meniere's disease in the post-traumatic setting did not appear greater than found in the general population. The clinical spectrum pertaining to recurrent vestibulopathy, Meniere's disease, delayed endolymphatic hydrops, drop attacks, superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, and uncompensated peripheral vestibular loss are discussed.

Ménière's disease: new guidelines, subtypes, imaging, and more.
This article reviews recent developments in Ménière's disease including etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic investigations that have changed the landscape for medical providers. These updates shed light onto the complex nature of Ménière's disease and generate additional means to provide optimal care to patients.
Given the multifactorial cause of Ménière's disease, five subtypes of Ménière's disease have recently been proposed. A knowledge of these subtypes will aid in the development of an appropriate treatment algorithm. Although newer treatments have not been developed, stepwise treatment algorithms have been proposed and can improve patient care. New MRI modalities and serum testing hold promise as clinical clues and biomarkers.
As these updated diagnostic criteria are used, Ménière's disease can be identified and treated more precisely. This will in turn allow for future randomized controlled studies to improve the quality of treatment options available. Future imaging, vestibular testing, and the potential for serum biomarkers may illuminate additional diagnostic criteria, only furthering the improvement in clinical care.

Vestibular and auditory manifestations of migraine.
The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss current literature about vestibular migraine and other cochleovestibular symptoms related to migraine.
Vestibular migraine affects 2.7% of the US population. Misdiagnosis is common. The pathophysiology is currently unknown but new research shows that calcitonin gene-related peptide, which is implicated in migraine headaches, is expressed in the audiovestibular periphery. A recent large-scale placebo-controlled trial looking at metoprolol for vestibular migraine was terminated early due to poor recruitment; however, at study completion, no differences were seen between treatment arms. Many other audiovestibular symptoms have been shown to be associated with migraine, including tinnitus, hearing loss, aural fullness, otalgia, and sinus symptoms. Migraine is also associated with risk for developing numerous otologic conditions, including Meniere's disease, vestibular loss, Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss. There is now some evidence that patients may experience fluctuating hearing loss and aural fullness without vertigo in association with migraine, which is called cochlear migraine.
Migraine can cause a variety of audiologic and vestibular symptoms, and further research is required to understand how migraine affects the inner ear.

Influence of sex hormones on vestibular disorders.
Vestibular disorders are gender distributed with a higher prevalence in women. Although research has increased in this field, the mechanisms underlying this unbalance is unclear. This review summarises recent advances in this research sphere, and briefly discusses sex hormone effects on various vestibular conditions and highlights some recent theories.
Recent work has identified a direct link between aberrant gonadal hormone levels and vestibular dysfunction. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo research suggests that the disorder may be linked to the rapid decrease in oestrogen, observed in menopausal women, which disrupts otoconial metabolism within the inner ear. A successful hormonal therapeutic intervention study has advanced our knowledge of hormonal influences in the inner ear in Ménière's disease. Also, several studies have focused on potential mechanisms involved in the interaction between Vestibular Migraine, Mal de Debarquement Syndrome, and gonadal hormones.
In females, gonadal hormones and sex-specific synaptic plasticity may play a significant role in the underlying pathophysiology of peripheral and central vestibular disorders. Overall, this review concludes that clinical assessment of female vestibular patients requires a multifaceted approach which includes auditory and vestibular medicine physicians, gynaecologists and/or endocrinologists, in conjunction with hormonal profile evaluations.

Triple semicircular canal occlusion: a surgical perspective with short- and long-term outcomes.
To determine the short- and long-term outcomes of triple semicircular canal occlusion as a potential alternative for patients with intractable Ménière's disease.
A retrospective case series was performed in university settings, enrolling patients with intractable Ménière's disease with previous maximum treatment, who underwent transmastoid, triple semicircular canal occlusion. The study documented: pre- and post-operative Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores at six weeks and one year post-treatment, pure tone audiometry, and surgical aspects.
Two female patients, aged 42 and 65 years, underwent unilateral three-semicircular-canal occlusion. Their respective Dizziness Handicap Inventory scores improved from 88 to 68 and 54 to 30 at six weeks post-operatively, with scores of 66 and 0 at one year post-treatment. The one patient with pre-existing functional hearing maintained her hearing threshold post-operatively.
Triple semicircular canal occlusion is a safe, hearing-preserving, extracranial alternative technique that can control rotatory vertigo in patients with intractable Ménière's disease, when other measures have failed.

A non-invasive, automated diagnosis of Menière's disease using radiomics and machine learning on conventional magnetic resonance imaging: A multicentric, case-controlled feasibility study.
This study investigated the feasibility of a new image analysis technique (radiomics) on conventional MRI for the computer-aided diagnosis of Menière's disease.
A retrospective, multicentric diagnostic case-control study was performed. This study included 120 patients with unilateral or bilateral Menière's disease and 140 controls from four centers in the Netherlands and Belgium. Multiple radiomic features were extracted from conventional MRI scans and used to train a machine learning-based, multi-layer perceptron classification model to distinguish patients with Menière's disease from controls. The primary outcomes were accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the classification model.
The classification accuracy of the machine learning model on the test set was 82%, with a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 82%. The positive and negative predictive values were 71%, and 90%, respectively.
The multi-layer perceptron classification model yielded a precise, high-diagnostic performance in identifying patients with Menière's disease based on radiomic features extracted from conventional T2-weighted MRI scans. In the future, radiomics might serve as a fast and noninvasive decision support system, next to clinical evaluation in the diagnosis of Menière's disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging of endolymphatic hydrops in patients with unilateral Meniere's disease: volume ratio and distribution rate of the endolymphatic space.
Endolymphatic hydrops (ELH), which is a pathological feature of Meniere's disease (MD), is characterized by an extended endolymphatic space (ELS).
We aimed to perform a quantitative volumetric analysis of inner-ear ELH in patients with unilateral MD (uMD).
This study included 97 patients with definite uMD and 49 control subjects (CS). The ELS/total fluid space (TFS) volume ratio (%) and the distribution rate of the inner-ear components in the ELS (%) were measured using 3D magnetic resonance imaging and compared between patients with uMD and CS.
Compared to CS, patients with uMD had significantly higher mean ELS/TFS volume ratios for inner-ear components. The mean distribution rate of the inner-ear components in the ELS was not significantly different between the two groups.
In patients with uMD, ELH was noted to be spread throughout the entire inner ear and the endolymph was evenly distributed in the total ELS. These findings should be useful as a standard reference for further research.

The influence of dizziness on the quality of life in elderly
Összefoglaló. Bevezetés: A szédülés időskorban gyakori panasz, amely jelentősen befolyásolja az életminőséget. Háttere sok esetben multifaktoriális, egyes esetekben azonban jól meghatározott ok kimutatható. Célkitűzés: Kutatásunk célja az időskori szédülő populáció panaszainak, valamint életminőségének felmérése volt. Anyag és módszer: Kutatásunkba 36 (13 férfi, 23 nőbeteg, átlagéletkor ± SD, 72,78 év ± 4,6), Otoneurológiai Ambulanciánkon szédülés miatt vizsgált, 65 év feletti beteget vontunk be. Ők az általunk összeállított, panaszokkal és rizikófaktorokkal kapcsolatos kérdőív mellett a Dizziness Handicap Inventory-t is kitöltötték. Az utóbbi alapján meghatározható volt az életminőség-romlás, illetve annak mértéke. A statisztikai elemzést az IBM SPSS V24 szoftver segítségével végeztük, Mann-Whitney U-teszt és khi-négyzet-próba alapján. Minden esetben p<0,05 értéket tekintettünk szignifikáns különbségnek. Eredmények: A leggyakoribb diagnózisként a Ménière-betegséget, valamint a centrális vestibularis eltéréseket detektáltuk. A betegek visszajelzése alapján a szédülés volt a legdominánsabb tünet, amely a leggyakrabban órákig, illetve napokig tartott, és fele arányban volt forgó jellegű. Emellett a fülzúgás, a halláscsökkenés, valamint a vegetatív tünetek is dominánsak voltak. A leggyakoribb társbetegségek közül gyakoriságuk miatt kiemelendők a mozgásszervi, illetve szemészeti eltérések, a hypertonia, valamint a pszichiátriai betegségek. A betegek 77,8%-a jelzett valamilyen mértékű életminőség-romlást, és kiemelendő, hogy 30%-uk a súlyos kategóriába esett. A Dizziness Handicap Inventory kérdőívek alapján a fizikális, funkcionális, valamint emocionális részpontszámok hasonló értéket mutattak. Következtetés: Az időskori szédülés lényeges a beteg romló életminősége szempontjából. A társuló komorbiditások mellett a háttérben álló vestibularis eltérések kizárása, illetve diagnosztizálása fontos feladat. Ennek függvényében tervezhető a terápia, amely kapcsán a kísérő tünetekre is fontos hangsúlyt fektetni. Így az érintett betegek életminősége javítható. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(47): 1891-1896.
Vertigo is a common complaint in elderly, which has significant influence on the patients' quality of life. In many cases its background is complex, although, in some cases specific diagnosis can be made.
Our study aimed to analyze the symptoms and quality of life of old-age vertiginous population.
36 patients (13 males, 23 females, mean age ± SD, 72.78 years ± 4.6) over 65 years, examined due to vertigo at our Neurotologic Department, were enrolled. A questionnaire including questions regarding the symptoms, risk factors, along with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory was used. Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS V24 software. Mann-Whitney U and chi square tests were used. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.
Ménière's disease and central vestibular disorders were found as the most frequent diagnoses. Vertigo was the most tormenting symptom, which usually lasted for hours or days, and was defined as rotatory in 50%. Tinnitus, hearing loss and vegetative symptoms were also dominant. The most frequent comorbidities were musculoskeletal disorders, hypertension, ophthalmological diseases and psychiatric disorders. 77.8% of the patients have reported worsened quality of life, of which 30% was detected as severe. Based on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, physical, functional and emotional scores showed similar results.
Vertigo in elderly is important due to its influence on patients' quality of life. Besides comorbidities, the diagnosis of vestibular pathologies is of great importance. Therefore, therapy planning is possible, and patients' quality of life can be improved. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(47): 1891-1896.

A Predictive Model of Bilateral Sensorineural Hearing Loss in Meniere Disease Using Clinical Data.
Meniere disease (MD) is defined by a clinical syndrome of recurrent attacks of spontaneous vertigo associated with tinnitus, aural fullness, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Most patients have unilateral SNHL, but some of them will develop contralateral SNHL during the course of the disease. Several studies have reported a frequency of 2 to 73% SNHL in the second ear, according to the duration of disease and the period of follow-up. We hypothesize that unilateral and bilateral MD are different conditions, the first would initially involve the apical turn of the cochlea, while bilateral MD would affect the entire length of the cochlea. The aim of the study is to search for clinical predictors of bilateral SNHL in MD to build a predictive model of bilateral involvement.
A retrospective, longitudinal study including two cohorts with a total of 400 patients with definite MD was carried out. The inception cohort consisted of 150 patients with MD and the validation cohort included 250 cases. All of the cases were diagnosed of unilateral MD according to their hearing loss thresholds. The following variables were assessed as predictors of bilateral SNHL for the two cohorts: sex, age of onset, familiar history of MD, migraine and high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL, defined if hearing threshold >20 dB in two or more consecutive frequencies from 2 to 8 KHz). A descriptive analysis was carried out according to the presence of HFHL in the first audiogram for the main variables. By using multiple logistic regression, we built-up several predictive models for the inception cohort and validated it with the replication cohort and merged dataset.
Twenty-three (19.3%) and 78 (41%) of patients with HFHL developed contralateral SNHL during the follow-up, in the inception and validation cohorts, respectively. In the inception cohort, the best predictive model included HFHL in the first audiogram (OR = 6.985, p = 0.063) and the absence of migraine (OR = 0.215, p = 0.144) as clinical predictors for bilateral SNHL [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.641, p = 0.002]. The model was validated in the second cohort (AUC = 0.621, p < 0.001). Finally, we merged both datasets to improve the precision of the model including HFHL in the first audiogram (OR = 3.168, p = 0.001), migraine (OR = 0.482, p = 0.036) and age of onset >35 years old (OR = 2.422, p = 0.006) as clinical predictors (AUC = 0.639, p < 0.001).
A predictive model including the age of onset, HFHL in the first audiogram and migraine can help to assess the risk of bilateral SNHL in MD. This model may have significant implications for clinical management of patients with MD.

Ductus Reuniens and Its Possible Role in Menière's Disease.
After 160 years the true underlying cause of Meniere's disease remains enigmatic. The aim of our study is to discuss the possible implication of an obstruction of the ductus reuniens as a cause in Menière's disease.
We first conducted an historical study of the description of the ductus reuniens. We then reviewed the literature regarding ductus reuniens obstruction in animal experiments, human post-mortem studies and living ear imaging. We completed its description by modern microCT imaging. Limited knowledge on the fate of dislodged saccular otoconia is summarized. The possible implications for Meniere's attacks are discussed.
Victor Hensen was the first to describe the ductus reuniens in 1863. He described its length and width and predicted that saccular otoconia might enter the ductus and the cochlea. On microCT the narrowest width of the human ductus reuniens was 0.14 mm. The literature reports cochlear endolymphatic hydrops occurring after animal experimental obstruction of the duct. Human postmortem studies have confirmed saccular otoconial clumps entering the ductus and the cochlea. A postmortem study has shown sites of endolymphatic obstruction, and imaging speculates on blockages in ears with Meniere's disease. Dislodged utricular otoconia can be in clumps of otolithic membranes.
Blockages of the ductus reuniens and at other endolymphatic system sites appear to be a feature in Meniere's disease ears. The blockages have been postulated to be saccular otoconia either causing or aggravating hydrops. This could be consistent with observed nystagmus reversals during attacks as the endolymphatic sac attempts to clear the hydrops and the otoconia.

Vestibular Aqueduct Size Correlates With the Degree of Cochlear Hydrops in Patients With and Without Menière's Disease.
To correlate the CT imaging findings of the visibility and size of the vestibular aqueduct (VA) with the degree of the cochlear hydrops determined in MRI late imaging of the hydrops. Study Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: A total of 127 patients (62 women, 65 men, average age 55.6 yrs): 86 of these were diagnosed with Menière's disease (American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery [AAO-HNS] criteria; 67 unilateral, 19 bilateral).
Temporal bone CT and hydrops MRI were performed in all patients.
Visibility/width of the VA in temporal bone CT and grade of cochlear hydrops evaluated by MRI.
The width of the VA is significantly smaller in patients diagnosed with Menière's disease (30% non-visible VA), compared with the patients who did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of Menière's disease (12% non-visible VA) (double sided Spearman correlation, p < 0.001). In all ears of patients diagnosed with Menière's disease the width of the VA was significantly correlated with the degree of the cochlear hydrops (in cases of non-visible VA 65% [34/52] ears presented with hydrops grade 3 or 4; 13% [7/52] ears presented with hydrops grade 1 or 2 and 21% [11/52] ears showed no hydrops) (Spearman correlation p = 0.001/p < 0.01). This is also true for all ears that can be summarized as hydrophic ear disease (symptomatic ears that present with a hydrops in MRI).
The results of our study could confirm the importance of the VA in the pathogenesis of the endolymphatic hydrops in vivo.

Interventions for Menière's disease: an umbrella systematic review.
To systematically review the efficacy of interventions for Menière's disease (MD) to report clinical implications of the results and to identify areas for future valuable research.
In line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Abstracts (PRISMA-A) guideline, a systematic online database search was conducted in which MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid) and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) were searched until May 2021 in order to search for the efficacy of treatment was analysed in a systematic review. Systematic reviews (SRs) on treatments for MD were screened for eligible interventions. From these SRs, we included placebo randomised controlled trials (RCTs). A separate search was conducted to identify RCTs on treatment modalities that were systematically reviewed yet published after the conduction of these SRs. The primary outcome was control of vertigo as defined by the American guideline as published in 1995. The PRISMA-A and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to appraise and evaluate the certainty of evidence.
We found five SRs from which 19 RCTs were extracted. Five RCTs were added by the separate search resulting in a total of 25 RCTs (n=1248) which evaluated the efficacy of betahistine dihydrochloride, intratympanic injections with gentamicin or steroids, endolymphatic sac surgery and pressure pulse therapy. Evidence on the efficacy of interventions for patients with MD is generally of low certainty. Betahistine (48 mg per day and 144 mg per day) and positive pressure therapy probably do not reduce MD symptoms when compared with placebo. Intratympanic injection with gentamicin or steroids, or treatment with endolymphatic surgery may reduce symptoms in MD when compared with placebo.
A definite effective and well-tolerated therapy for MD has yet to be discovered and information on the natural course of disease is one of the biggest flaws in current research.

Combined Endoscopic/Microscopic Cochlear Implantation Through the Oval Window.
Standard round window (RW) cochlear implantation is a well-described technique. Implantation might be difficult in patients with inner and middle ear anomalies, in some cases because of not achieving adequate exposure to the RW, with a related higher risk of complications such as facial nerve injury. It is proposed a combined microscopic/endoscopic oval window approach in a 63 year old man affected by bilateral Menière disease, with bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss, speech discrimination score for bysillabic words under 40% and a hidden RW by anomalous facial nerve course. All electrodes entered the cochlear with good freefield thresholds and auditory ability results. A partial marginalis nerve palsy occurred at the second postoperative day and completely reversed at 2 months from surgery. Endoscopicassisted oval window cochlear implantation may be a safe alternative surgical technique in cases where surgeons are not able to access RW.

Asymptomatic superior semicircular canal dehiscence.
To describe a case of asymptomatic superior semicircular canal dehiscence.
Clinical case report.
A 50-year-old man presenting with right-sided Ménière´s disease also showed an enhanced response on vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing for the left ear. Unilateral left-sided superior semicircular canal bone dehiscence was clearly visualised on a subsequent temporal bone computed tomography scan. These findings were consistent with superior canal dehiscence syndrome. However, the patient did not complain of any specific superior canal dehiscence syndrome symptoms. Given that vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing may detect asymptomatic forms of superior canal dehiscence, as noted in this case, such testing seems to exhibit reduced specificity for superior canal dehiscence syndrome.
An enhanced response on vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing in isolation appears to be a weaker indicator of superior canal dehiscence syndrome, and rather a marker of superior semicircular canal dehiscence.

A finite element model to predict the consequences of endolymphatic hydrops in the basilar membrane.
Ménière's disease is an inner ear disorder, associated with episodes of vertigo, fluctuant hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Ménière's disease is associated with endolymphatic hydrops. Clinical evidences show that this disease is often incapacitating, negatively affecting the patients' everyday life. The pathogenesis of Ménière's disease is still not fully understood and remains unclear. Previous numerical studies available in the literature related with endolymphatic hydrops, are very scarce. The present work applies the finite element method to investigate the consequences of endolymphatic hydrops in the normal hearing, associated with the Ménière's disease. The obtained results for the steady state dynamics analysis are in accordance with clinical evidences. The results show that the basilar membrane is not affected in the same intensity along its length and that the lower frequencies are more affected by the endolymphatic hydrops. From a clinical point of view, this work shows the relationship between the increasing of the endolymphatic pressure and the development of hearing loss.

Magnetic resonance imaging: Role on diagnosing all types of endolymphatic hydrops.
This study utilized the recently advanced technique in MR imaging to establish its role on diagnosing all types of endolymphatic hydrops (EH).
Twenty-two patients (26 ears) with clinical EH were admitted due to acute hearing loss and/or vertiginous attack. Each patient underwent an inner ear test battery comprising audiometry, cervical and ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential tests, and caloric test, followed by MR imaging for confirmation.
Of the 22 clinical EH patients, 12 patients were referred to primary EH (Meniere's disease), 8 patients were secondary EH (including delayed EH in 5), and 2 patients were EH of embryopathic origin. MR imaging of 26 affected ears demonstrated EH in the cochlea only for 14 ears, in the utricle and saccule only for 1 ear, and in all three endorgans for 3 ears, accounting for a sensitivity of 69% (18/26). The 8 affected ears showing negative MR images were EH patients with hearing recovery 1, just after vertiginous attack 3, and chronic low-tone hearing loss 4. In contrast, 3 out of 18 unaffected ears demonstrated asymptomatic EH in the cochlea, representing a specificity of 83% (15/18).
The sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging for confirming all types of EH were 69% and 83%, respectively. Although diagnostic criteria can identify primary and delayed EH, MR imaging may provide a supplementary tool for diagnosing secondary, embryopathic, or asymptomatic EH, if patients are not with hearing recovery, chronic low-tone hearing loss, or just after vertiginous attack.

Association Between Asthma and Meniere's Disease: A Nested Case-Control Study.
This study aimed to investigate the association between Meniere's disease and prior history of asthma.
A nested case-control study.
Among the patients aged ≥40 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort 2002-2015, 7,734 diagnosed with Meniere's disease between 2004 and 2015 were enrolled in this study. From the 505,834 participants without a prior history of Meniere's disease, 30,936 control participants were selected based on age, sex, income, and region of residence. The presence of a prior history of asthma before the diagnosis of Meniere's disease was compared between the Meniere's disease group and control group using conditional logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
Prior history of asthma was associated with 1.30 (1.21-1.39) times higher odds of Meniere's disease (E-value = 1.92 [1.71]). Both allergic asthma and nonallergic asthma patients demonstrated higher odds of Meniere's disease than the control group (adjusted OR = 1.21 [1.08-1.36] and E-value = 1.72 [1.37] for allergic asthma; adjusted OR = 1.26 [1.17-1.36] and E-value = 1.83 [1.60] for nonallergic asthma).
This study is the first to demonstrate a positive relationship between Meniere's disease and prior asthma history in adults. The association between prior asthma history and Meniere's disease was noted in both allergic and nonallergic asthma cases. The potential development of Meniere's disease should be considered when managing the asthma patients with dizziness or vertigo.

A systematic quality appraisal of clinical practice guidelines for Ménière's disease using the AGREE II instrument.
To systematically appraise clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Ménière's disease using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument.
A systematic literature search was performed to identify guidelines pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of Ménière's disease. Data were abstracted from guidelines that met inclusion criteria and appraised by four independent reviewers in the six domains of quality defined by the AGREE II. Domain scores reflecting quality in each domain were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated across domains to qualify interrater reliability.
Six guidelines were found to meet inclusion criteria after a systematic literature search. Of the six clinical practice guidelines appraised using the AGREE II, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guideline received the highest average score, with a mean of 90.7% spanning six quality domains. The guideline with the lowest average score across all domains was the European Position Statement on diagnosis and treatment of Ménière's disease, receiving an average score across domains of 34.6%. Overall quality scores of clinical practice guidelines for Ménière's disease had a standard deviation of 21.3%. Two guidelines met the quality threshold of > 60% in at least five domains, qualifying as 'high': AAO-HNS and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Average ICC across all six domains was 0.87, suggesting near total agreement between reviewers.
Ménière's disease remains a challenging entity to diagnose and treat; few existing clinical guidelines meet the standards of quality established by the AGREE II appraisal instrument.

Evaluation of Industry Relationships Among Authors of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Regarding Ménières Disease.
To quantify the presence of conflicts of interest (COI) in SRs and MAs of Ménières disease treatment and identify any related secondary characteristics of these articles.
A search was conducted on May 28, 2020 to search MEDLINE and Embase databases for SRs or MAs pertaining to Ménières disease published between September 1, 2016 and June 2, 2020. A risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias assessment criteria.
A total of 13 systematic reviews conducted by 49 authors met the inclusion criteria. Of the 49 authors, 7 (14.3%) were found to have some form of COI. Of these 7 authors, 1 (14.3%) completely disclosed all COI within the SR, 1 (14.3%) disclosed one or more COI but were found to have an additional undisclosed COI, and 5 (71.4%) were found to have only undisclosed COI. One of 2 industry funded SRs (50%) had a high risk of bias, and 1 (50%) of the non-industry sponsored SRs were found to have a high risk of bias.
Overall authors of SRs pertaining to Ménières disease appear to be properly disclosing COI at higher rates than other fields of medicine; however, further room for improvement has been noted.

Intraoperative Electrocochleography in Subjects Affected by Vestibular Schwannoma and Ménière's Disease: Comparison of Results.
Histologic reports of temporal bones of ears with vestibular schwannomas (VSs) have indicated findings of endolymphatic hydrops (ELH) in some cases. The main goal of this investigation was to test ears with VSs to determine if they exhibit electrophysiological characteristics similar to those of ears expected to experience ELH.
Fifty-three subjects with surgically confirmed VS aged ≥18 and with normal middle ear status were included in this study. In addition, a second group of adult subjects (n = 24) undergoing labyrinthectomy (n = 6) or endolymphatic sac decompression and shunt (ELS) placement (n = 18) for poorly controlled vestibular symptoms associated with Meniere's disease (MD) participated in this research. Intraoperative electrocochleography (ECochG) from the round window was performed using tone burst stimuli. Audiometric testing and word recognition scores (WRS) were performed preoperatively. ECochG amplitudes, cochlear microphonic/auditory nerve neurophonic (ANN) in the form of the "ongoing" response and summation potential, were analyzed and compared between the two groups of subjects. In addition, to evaluate any effect of auditory nerve function, the auditory nerve score was calculated for each subject. Pure-tone averages were obtained using the average air conduction thresholds at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz while WRS was assessed using Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 word lists.
In the VS group the average pure-tone averages and WRS were 59.6 dB HL and 44.8%, respectively, while in the MD group they were 52.3 dB HL and 73.8%. ECochG findings in both groups revealed a reduced trend in amplitude of the ongoing response with increased stimulus frequency. The summation potential amplitudes of subjects with VS were found to be less negative than the MD subjects for nearly all test frequencies. Finally, the VS group exhibited poorer amounts of auditory nerve function compared to the MD group.
The current findings suggest cochlear pathology (e.g., hair cell loss) in both groups but do not support the hypothesis that VSs cause ELH.

Estimated prevalence and characteristics of bilateral vestibulopathy diagnosed in Japan: A nationwide survey.
To assess the prevalence and annual incidence of bilateral vestibulopathy (BV) diagnosed in the Japanese adult population.
We conducted a mail-based survey targeting otolaryngologic clinics and hospitals across Japan to estimate the annual number of patients who were diagnosed as having bilateral vestibulopathy after vestibular function tests during a 12-month period ending March 2019. Using a stratified sampling method, we selected 1,106 departments and asked them to report the number of patients with BV and their demographics. The total number of patients was estimated by multiplying the reported numbers by the reciprocal of the sampling rate and response rate.
The overall survey response rate was 51.4% (568 departments). The estimated number of patients diagnoses with BV in 2018 was 1,063 (95% confidential interval [CI], 127-1,998) which included 407 patients (95% CI: 134-680) newly-diagnosed with BV. The prevalence and annual incidence of BV in Japan were 0.84 and 0.32, respectively per 100,000 population in Japan. The male-to-female ratio of BV patients was 1.29, and the mean age was 63.7 ± 16.4 years (range 18-84 years). The most frequent etiologies of BV were Meniere's disease (11.4%), meningitis (3.4%), and ototoxic agents (3%).
Patients who were diagnosed as having BV were extremely rare in Japan.

Results of subjective visual vertical tests in patients with vertigo/dizziness.
We previously established the head-tilt subjective visual vertical (HT-SVV) test to evaluate head-tilt perception gain (HTPG) in addition to the original head-upright SVV (HU-SVV) test (Wada-Y et al.: Laryngoscope Investig Otolaryngol, 2020). In this study, we aimed to investigate the HU-SVV and HT-SVV abnormality rates among patients with vertigo/dizziness.
Between July 2014 and December 2020, 357 patients were hospitalized for examining the HU-SVV and HT-SVV at our vertigo/dizziness center. Among these patients, 120 had Meniere's disease (MD), 99 had unilateral vestibular disease (UVD), 76 had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), 14 had vestibular migraine (VM), 13 had orthostatic dysfunction (OD), 12 had bilateral vestibular disease (BVD), 12 had central dizziness (CD), 7 had vestibular schwannoma (VS), and 4 had psychogenic dizziness (PD). We determined the reference values of the absolute HU-SVV (<2.5°) and HTPG (0.80-1.25) for the sitting position and used these for calculating the HU-SVV and HT-SVV abnormality rates in each type of vertigo/dizziness.
Among the 357 patients, 111 had abnormal HU-SVV results (31.1%), 132 had abnormal HT-SVV results (37.0%), and 185 had abnormal HU-SVV and/or HT-SVV results (51.8%). The modified HT-SVV test in combination with the original HU-SVV test could detect gravity perception disturbance in patients with vertigo/dizziness significantly better than the original test alone (chi-square: p=0.00019). The HU-SVV, HT-SVV, and HU-SVV and/or HT-SVV abnormality rates were significantly higher in patients with peripheral vestibular diseases, i.e., MD, UVD, BPPV, and BVD than in those with other types of vertigo/dizziness, i.e., VM, OD, CD, VS, and PD (chi-square: p=0.010, p=0.020, and p=0.0025, respectively).
These findings suggest that the combined HT-SVV and HU-SVV test could be a powerful neuro-otologic examination for detecting pathologies in the vestibular otolithic pathway.

Evaluating the Role of Otologic Biomarkers to Differentiate Meniere's Disease and Vestibular Migraine.
To evaluate the role for prestin and otolin-1 as biomarkers for differentiating Meniere's disease (MD) from vestibular migraine (VM).
It is a cross-sectional, cohort study.
There were 19 MD and 11 VM patients. In the 19 MD patients, the mean prestin level was 2.33 ng/ml compared to 0.64 ng/ml in VM patients (p = 0.238). Otolin-1 levels in MD patients were 109.67 pg/ml, while in VM patients, otolin-1 levels were 30.9 pg/ml (p = 0.102). In MD patients, prestin levels were correlated with word recognition scores, being strongest when prestin >2 ng/ml (rho = 0.9; p = 0.019).
Prestin and otolin-1 levels differed between MD patients relative to VM patients. The relationship between prestin and word recognition scores in MD suggests that there may be a role for prestin as a marker for inner ear function, but its role in differentiating MD from VM remains to be elucidated.

Posterior petrous face meningiomas presenting with Ménière's-like syndrome: a case series and review of the literature.
Ménière's disease is an inner ear disorder classically characterized by fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness accompanied by episodic vertigo. While the pathogenesis of Ménière's remains under debate, histopathological analyses implicate endolymphatic sac dysfunction with inner ear fluid homeostatic dysregulation. Little is known about whether external impingement of the endolymphatic sac by tumors may present with Ménière's-like symptoms. The authors present a case series of 7 patients with posterior fossa meningiomas that involved the endolymphatic sac and new onset of Ménière's-like symptoms and review the literature on this rare clinical entity.
A retrospective review of patients undergoing resection of a posterior petrous meningioma was performed at the authors' institution. Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years; patients presenting with Ménière's-like symptoms, including episodic vertigo, aural fullness, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss; and tumor location overlying the endolymphatic sac.
There were 7 cases of posterior petrous face meningiomas involving the vestibular aperture presenting with Ménière's-like symptoms. Imaging and intraoperative examination confirmed no cranial nerve VIII compression or labyrinthine artery involvement accounting for audiovestibular symptoms. Of the 7 patients in the series, 6 experienced significant improvement or resolution of their vertigo, and all 7 had improvement or resolution of their tinnitus after resection. Of the 5 patients who had preoperative hearing loss, 2 experienced improvement or resolution of their ipsilateral preoperative hearing deficit, whereas the other 3 had unchanged hearing loss compared to preoperative evaluation.
Petrous face meningiomas overlying the endolymphatic sac can present with a Ménière's syndrome. Early recognition and microsurgical excision of these tumors is critical for resolution of most symptoms and stabilization of hearing loss.

Clinical, oculographic and vestibular test characteristics of Ménière's disease.
Seventy Ménière's disease (MD) patients with spontaneous vertigo (100%), unilateral aural fullness (57.1%), tinnitus (78.6%), and subjective hearing loss (75.7%) self-recorded nystagmus during their episodes of vertigo using portable video oculography goggles. All demonstrated ictal spontaneous nystagmus, horizontal in 94.3% (n = 66) and vertical in 5.7% (n = 4), with a mean slow-phase velocity (SPV) of 42.8 ± 31.1°/s (range 5.3-160.1). Direction reversal of spontaneous horizontal nystagmus was captured in 58.6%, within the same episode in 34.3%, and over different days in 24.3%. In 18.6%, we observed ipsiversive then contraversive nystagmus, and in 12.9% contraversive to ipsiversive direction reversal. Ictal nystagmus SPV (42.8 ± 31.1°/s) was significantly faster than interictal (1.4 ± 3.1°/s, p < 0.001, CI 34.277-48.776). Compared to age-matched healthy controls, interictal video head impulse test gains in MD ears were significantly lower, cumulative and first saccade (S1) amplitudes were significantly larger, and S1 peak velocities were significantly faster (p = 0.038/0.019/0.008/ < 0.001, CI 0.002-0.071/0.130-1.444/0.138-0.909/14.614-41.506). Audiometry showed asymmetrically increased thresholds in 100% of MD ears (n = 70). Significant caloric, air-conducted (AC) cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP), and AC ocular VEMP asymmetries were found in 61.4, 37.9, and 44.4% of patients (MD ear reduced). Transtympanic electrocochleography tested in 36 ears (23 patients) showed 81.8% of MD ears had a positive result for hydrops (either a summating potential at 1/2 kHz < - 6 µV, or an SP/AP ratio > 40%). Using ictal nystagmus findings of SPV > 12°/s, and a caloric canal paresis > 25%, we correctly separated a diagnosis MD from Vestibular Migraine with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.7% and 85.1% (CI 0.89-0.97).

Current diagnosis and treatment of vestibular neuritis: a narrative review.
Vertigo is the sensation of self-motion of the head or body when no self-motion is occurring or the sensation of distorted self-motion during an otherwise normal head movement. Representative peripheral vertigo disorders include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Ménière disease, and vestibular neuritis. Vestibular neuritis, also known as vestibular neuronitis, is the third most common peripheral vestibular disorder after benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and Ménière disease. The cause of vestibular neuritis remains unclear. However, a viral infection of the vestibular nerve or ischemia of the anterior vestibular artery is known to cause vestibular neuritis. In addition, recent studies on immune-mediated mechanisms as the cause of vestibular neuritis have been reported. The characteristic clinical features of vestibular neuritis are abrupt true-whirling vertigo lasting for more than 24 hours, and no presence of cochlear symptoms and other neurological symptoms and signs. To accurately diagnose vestibular neuritis, various diagnostic tests such as the head impulse test, bithermal caloric test, and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test are conducted. Various treatments for vestibular neuritis have been reported, which are largely divided into symptomatic therapy, specific drug therapy, and vestibular rehabilitation therapy. Symptomatic therapies include generalized supportive care and administration of vestibular suppressants and antiemetics. Specific drug therapies include steroid therapy, antiviral therapy, and vasodilator therapy. Vestibular rehabilitation therapies include generalized vestibular and customized vestibular exercises.

Capturing vertigo in the emergency room: three tools to double the rate of diagnosis.
Many patients attending the emergency room (ER) with vertigo, leave without a diagnosis. We assessed whether the three tools could improve ER diagnosis of vertigo.
A prospective observational study was undertaken on 539 patients presenting to ER with vertigo. We used three tools: a structured-history and examination, nystagmus video-oculography (VOG) in all patients, additional video head-impulse testing (vHIT) for acute-vestibular-syndrome (AVS).
In the intervention-group (n = 424), case-history classified AVS in 34.9%, episodic spontaneous-vertigo (ESV 32.1%), and episodic positional-vertigo (EPV 22.6%). In AVS, we employed "Quantitative-HINTS plus" (Head-Impulse, Nystagmus and Test-of-Skew quantified by vHIT and VOG, audiometry) to identify vestibular-neuritis (VN) and stroke (41.2 and 31.1%). vHIT gain ≤ 0.72, catch-up saccade amplitude > 1.4

Paroxysmal positional-nystagmus lasting < 60 s separated BPV from non-BPV with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In the control group of ER patients undergoing management-as-usual (n = 115), diagnoses included BPV (38.3%) and non-specific vertigo (41.7%). Unblinded assessors reached a final diagnosis in 90.6 and 30.4% of the intervention and control groups. Blinded assessors provided with the data gathered from each group reached a diagnosis in 86.3 and 41.1%.
Three tools: a structured-assessment, vHIT and VOG doubled the rate of diagnosis in the ER.

Evolution of incidence of audiovestibular disorders during the pandemic COVID-19 period.
Despite sporadic case reports describing hearing problems in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether COVID-19 affects the audiovestibular system remains unclear. This study assessed the evolution of incidence of audiovestibular disorders during the pandemic COVID-19 period.
Three audiovestibular disorders namely, sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL), autonomic dysfunction, and Meniere's disease (MD) were analyzed and compared from 2016 to 2020.
The annual new cases at our clinic comprised overall 2107, 1997, 1984, 2068, and 1829 from 2016 to 2020, respectively, and the respectively annual cases of SSHL were 54, 46, 42, 45 and 38. Accordingly, annual incidences of SSHL in relation to overall cases of audiovestibular disorders were 2.6%, 2.3%, 2.1%, 2.2% and 2.1% from 2016 to 2020, respectively, exhibiting a non-significant difference (p > 0.05). In contrast, incidence of autonomic dysfunction in the year 2020 was 15.3%, which revealed significantly higher than 8.5-13.1% from 2016 to 2019 (p < 0.001). Restated, the incidence of autonomic dysfunction in 2020 displayed a significantly higher percentage than the other 4 years. Conversely, the incidence of MD in 2020 was 9.8%, showing a significant decline compared with the other 4 years (12.6-15.6% from 2016 to 2019, p < 0.001), CONCLUSION: Evolution of incidence of audiovestibular disorders during the pandemic COVID-19 period revealed increase in the incidence of autonomic dysfunction and decrease in that of MD, while incidence of SSHL remained unchanged from 2016 to 2020. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 may less affect the audiovestibular system.

Exploratory saccades data analysis of video head impulse test in different Meniere's disease stages.
Unapparent saccades in video head impulse test (vHIT) are usually present in Meniere's disease (MD) patients but tend to be ignored by the clinician. The result of vHIT is constantly questioned in MD patients due to a lack of uniform metrics. A more effective indicator is needed for indicating MD's pathological progress.
To get a comprehensive understanding of the nature and usability of saccades in different MD stages.
118 patients diagnosed with unilateral MD were recruited in this study. Patient history, audiological examination, caloric test, vHIT were performed. We proposed 'raw saccades' to represent all showed wave peaks behind the head peak and named saccades by their appearance sequence: 1st saccade, 2nd saccade and 3rd saccade. An exploratory saccade analysis was executed to investigate the effectiveness of saccade attributes in identifying MD stages.
MD patients have greater detectable 1st saccade than PR score as well as 2nd saccade. The time and velocity of the 1st saccade show high interaural variability (p = 0.028, p = 0.000 respectively). No statistical difference concerning the vHIT gain, PR score and 2nd saccade among stages could be recognized on both affected and contralateral sides. Multiple comparisons show the affected 1st saccade velocity and affected 1st saccade absolute velocity have stage-difference. At late stages (3&4), the affected 1st saccade is manifested as a speed increase, and this measure shows a relatively high correlation with MD stages compared to other vestibular indicators.
The 1st saccade velocity on the affected side could indicate the MD disease process and severity.

Recurrence Rate and Risk Factors of Recurrence in Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo: a Single-Center Long-Term Prospective Study With a Large Cohort.
This study aimed to assess the long-term recurrence rate and correlations between recurrence and potential risk factors in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).
A total of 548 consecutive patients who demonstrated typical posterior or horizontal BPPV between January 2010 and December 2012 were included in this prospective study. All patients were contacted by phone every 6 months for 5 years and were asked to revisit the clinic when they experienced positional vertigo to be reexamined for recurrence. Recurrence of BPPV was defined as having positional vertigo and nystagmus confirmed following a symptom-free period of at least 7 days after complete resolution. We assessed the 5-year recurrence rate of BPPV, and the time point of recurrence in all patients as well as the risk factors of BPPV recurrence, including the clinical characteristics, therapeutic results of BPPV, and various comorbidities.
Among the 548 patients, 121 (22.1 %) had at least one recurrence. Of these, 78 patients (54.5%) had only one recurrence within 5 years, while 43 (45.5%) patients experienced two or more recurrences. A recurrence occurred within 1 year in 82 patients (67.8%). The Cox proportional hazard ratio analysis found that head trauma (p = 0.015), Meniere's disease (p = 0.016), the number of canalith repositioning procedures performed (p = 0.037), and the number of previous vertigo attacks (p = 0.038) were significant risk factors of BPPV recurrence as opposed to hypertension or hyperlipidemia.
The recurrence rate of BPPV was 22.1% at 5 years after the initial treatment. About 70% of recurred patients had a recurrence within 1 year. Head trauma, ipsilateral Meniere's disease, the number of canalith repositioning procedures performed, and the number of previous vertigo attacks were significant risk factors of BPPV recurrence.

Betahistine in Ménière's Disease or Syndrome: A Systematic Review.
Ménière's disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus, often with a feeling of fullness in the ear. Although betahistine is thought to be specifically effective for Ménière's disease, no evidence for a benefit from the use of betahistine exists, despite its widespread use. Reassessment of the effect of betahistine for Ménière's disease is now warranted.
We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials, in which betahistine was compared to placebo.
Our outcomes involved vertigo, significant adverse effect (upper gastrointestinal discomfort), hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, other adverse effects, and disease-specific health-related quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.
We included 10 studies: 5 studies used a crossover design and the remaining 5 were parallel-group RCTs. One study with a low risk of bias found no significant difference between the betahistine groups and placebo with respect to vertigo after a long-term follow-up period. No significant difference in the incidence of upper gastrointestinal discomfort was found in 2 studies (low-certainty evidence). No differences in hearing loss, tinnitus, or well-being and disease-specific health-related quality of life were found (low- to very low-certainty of evidence). Data on aural fullness could not be extracted. No significant difference between the betahistine and the placebo groups (low-certainty evidence) could be demonstrated in the other adverse effect outcome with respect to dull headache. The pooled risk ratio for other adverse effect in the long term demonstrated a lower risk in favor of placebo over betahistine.
High-quality studies evaluating the effect of betahistine on patients with Ménière's disease are lacking. However, one study with low risk of bias found no evidence of a difference in the effect of betahistine on the primary outcome, vertigo, in patients with Ménière's disease when compared to placebo. The main focus of future research should be on the use of comparable outcome measures by means of patient-reported outcome measures.

The clinical characteristics and anatomical variations in patients with intractable unilateral Meniere's disease with and without migraine.
Migraine is more common in Meniere's disease patients, who have some certain anatomical variations. But there are limited studies focusing on the anatomical variations in patients with Meniere's disease and migraine.
To explore the clinical and anatomical features in Meniere's disease patients with and without migraine, determining whether the coexistence of migraine can be used as a basis for clinical subtyping of Meniere's disease.
Ninety-five Meniere's disease patients and ninety-five healthy subjects matched with age, sex were selected. A detailed questionnaire based on the diagnosis criteria of Meniere's disease and migraine was designed. According to the CT scan, we divided the mastoid cell system of all the subjects into two types: well-pneumatization type and poor-pneumatization type. Meanwhile, the shortest distance between the sigmoid sinus and the posterior wall of the external acoustic canal was measured.
Compared with those without migraine, Meniere's disease patients with migraine had a higher female comorbidity, poorer mastoid pneumatization, shorter distance between the sigmoid sinus and posterior wall of the external acoustic canal, longer history, higher frequency of vertigo attacks and better average hearing threshold.
In our study, anatomical features as well as several clinical manifestations were proved to differ significantly between Meniere's disease patients with and without migraine, indicating the coexistence of migraine may be one standard for the clinical subtyping of Meniere's disease.

3D-reconstructions of Bast's Valve and Membranous Labyrinth: Insights for Vestibular Implantation and Meniere's Disease.
Bast's valve is a poorly understood inner ear structure located at the junction between pars superior and inferior in the membranous labyrinth. Anatomically precise three-dimensional reconstructions (3D-reconstructions) of Bast's valve can help illuminate the morphology of the valve, and point toward its role in normal physiology and pathological states such as endolymphatic hydrops. This is of particular relevance to the development of a vestibular implant, a device intended to rehabilitate deficits in the vestibular system.
Six postmortem human temporal bones from healthy donors were scanned using a micro-computed tomography (microCT) scanner. The microCT data allowed 3D-reconstructions of the membranous labyrinth, with a particular focus on Bast's valve, vestibule, and cochlear duct.
The microCT images of Bast's valve showed a rigid lip containing a core of soft tissue, opposing the thin membranous wall of the utricle. The maximum recorded length and width of the rigid lip were 440.4 μm and 88 μm, respectively. The 3D-reconstructions illustrated the slit-like opening of Bast's valve into the utricle, the twisting course of the basal turn of the cochlear duct, and the spatial orientation of utricle and saccule with respect to the stapes footplate.
The present study provided a novel anatomical perspective on the microscopic structure of Bast's valve. The interplay between endolymphatic hydrops and Bast's valve is an ongoing area of research, but defining this anatomy in 3D will play a key role in furthering our understanding of the disease process. Implications for vestibular implantation are explored through the various 3D-reconstructions.

Diagnosis of Menière's disease according to the criteria of 2015: Characteristics and challenges in 96 patients.
The diagnosis of Menière's disease (MD) is made according to diagnostic criteria, the last revision of which was in 2015. For diagnosis, symptoms are weighted with audiometric findings and this can be challenging in individual patients.
To analyze patient's characteristics and symptoms in a real-life cohort of 96 patients with diagnosed MD regarding sociodemographic parameters, clinical specifics, and audiometry.
Prospective clinical patient registry containing demographic and socioeconomic parameters, symptoms, as well as pure-tone audiometry data.
31 patients with definite MD, and 36 with probable MD were identified. 29 patients showed typical clinical signs of MD, but did not meet the full diagnostic criteria, and were considered separately. Mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 3.9±4.6 years. Significant differences between categories were found regarding aural fullness, tinnitus, and fluctuating hearing. If multiple audiograms were available, 28.6 % (6/21) documented fluctuating hearing.
Current diagnostic criteria probably do not represent patients with monosymptomatic presentation or an early stage very well. Long-term follow-up with repeated audiometry is advisable.

Disruption of self-motion perception without vestibular reflex alteration in ménière's disease.
Self-motion misperception has been observed in vestibular patients during asymmetric body oscillations. This misperception is correlated with the patient's vestibular discomfort.
To investigate whether or not self-motion misperception persists in post-ictal patients with Ménière's disease (MD).
Twenty-eight MD patients were investigated while in the post-ictal interval. Self-motion perception was studied by examining the displacement of a memorized visual target after sequences of opposite directed fast-slow asymmetric whole body rotations in the dark. The difference in target representation was analyzed and correlated with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) score. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and clinical tests for ocular reflex were also evaluated.
All MD patients showed a noticeable difference in target representation after asymmetric rotation depending on the direction of the fast/slow rotations. This side difference suggests disruption of motion perception. The DHI score was correlated with the amount of motion misperception. In contrast, VOR and clinical trials were altered in only half of these patients.
Asymmetric rotation reveals disruption of self-motion perception in MD patients during the post-ictal interval, even in the absence of ocular reflex impairment. Motion misperception may cause persistent vestibular discomfort in these patients.

Investigation of endolymphatic hydrops positivity rates in patients with recurrent audiovestibular symptoms using inner ear magnetic resonance imaging.
This study aimed to investigate the endolymphatic hydrops (EH)-positivity rates among patients with recurrent audiovestibular symptoms using intravenous injection of gadolinium-enhanced inner ear magnetic resonance imaging (ieMRI).
We reviewed 710 successive patients with recurrent audiovestibular symptoms at the Vertigo/Dizziness Center of Nara Medical University and other related hospitals, between May 2014 and April 2020. We performed ieMRI on 153 patients with unilateral recurrent cochleovestibular symptoms (rCV), 51 with recurrent vertigo symptoms (rVO), and 84 with unilateral recurrent cochlear symptoms (rCO).
EH was observed in 69.4% of the participants: 81.7% in the rCV group, 19.6% in the rVO group, and 77.4% in the rCO group. The participants were divided into two groups according to the disease duration: short-duration and long-duration groups. In the short-duration group (less than 4 years), EH was observed in 82.3%, 42.9%, and 71.4% of the patients in rCV, rVO, and rCO groups, respectively; in the long-duration group (more than 5 years), EH was observed in 81.1%, 10.8%, and 81.6% of the patients in rCV, rVO, and rCO groups, respectively.
The longer the duration of the disease, the larger the EH-positivity rates in patients with rCO, smaller in those with rVO, and unchanged in those with rCV. Although ieMRI could not detect EH with 100% accuracy in Ménière's disease, the present pathological statistics of patients with recurrent audiovestibular symptoms might be helpful in considering the pathology-based treatment strategy.

High-quality imaging of endolymphatic hydrops acquired in 7 minutes using sensitive hT
It is still challenging to detect endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in patients with Meniere's disease (MD) using MRI. The aim of the present study was to optimize a sensitive technique generating strong contrast enhancement from minimum gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) while reliably detecting EH in the inner ear, including the apex.
All imaging was performed using a 3.0 T MR system 24 h after intratympanic injection of low-dose Gd-DTPA. Heavily T2-weighted 3-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery reconstructed with magnitude and zero-filled interpolation (hT

W-FLAIR-MZFI yielded high-quality images with sharper and smoother borders between the endolymph and perilymph and a higher signal intensity ratio and more homogenous perilymph enhancement than those generated with MIIRMR (p < 0.01). There were predominantly grade II EHs in the cochleae and grade III EHs in the vestibule in definite MD. EH was detected in the apex of 11/16 ipsilateral ears, 3/16 contralateral ears in unilateral definite MD and 3/6 ears in bilateral MD.

Episodic versus Chronic Dizziness: An Analysis of Predictive Factors.
To elucidate differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with episodic and chronic dizziness.
A cross-sectional, observational study of 217 adults referred for dizziness at 1 tertiary center was undertaken. Subjects were split into a chronic dizziness group (>15 dizzy days per month) and an episodic dizziness group (<15 dizzy days per month).
217 adults (average age, 53.7 years; 56.7% female) participated. One-third (n = 74) met criteria for chronic dizziness. Dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) scores were significantly higher in those with chronic dizziness compared to those with episodic dizziness (53.9 vs 40.7; 
P
 < .001). Comorbid depression and anxiety were more prevalent in those with chronic dizziness (44.6% and 47.3% vs 37.8% and 35.7%, respectively; 
P
 > .05). Abnormal vestibular testing and abnormal imaging studies did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Ménière's disease and BPPV were significantly more common among those with episodic dizziness, while the prevalence of vestibular migraine did not differ according to chronicity of symptoms. A multivariate regression that included age, sex, DHI, history of anxiety and/or depression, associated symptoms, and dizziness triggers was able to account for 15% of the variance in the chronicity of dizziness (pseudo-

Those who suffer from chronic dizziness have significantly higher DHI and high comorbid rates of depression and anxiety than those with episodic dizziness. Our findings show that factors other than diagnosis alone are important in the chronification of dizziness, an observation that could help improve on multimodal treatment options for this group of patients.

Wideband tympanometry as a diagnostic tool for Meniere's disease: a retrospective case-control study.
The main purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of wide band tympanometry (WBT) as a diagnostic tool for Ménière's disease (MD) by comparing differences in absorbance measures between normal hearing ears and patient diagnosed with MD.
We conducted a retrospective case-control study. From a cohort of 116 patients diagnosed with Ménière disease, 52 MD patients and 99 normal hearing adults with no history of otological disease served as subjects. Wideband tympanometry was conducted using at Titan Impedance module and audiometry was performed with a MADSEN Astera
2
. Mean energy absorbance curves with 95% confidence intervals were computed across cases with MD and controls in the frequency range 226-8000 Hz. An overall test for difference between curves of cases and controls was calculated by multivariate analysis of variance.
The MD group and the subpopulations of MD patients who fulfilled the International criteria for MD showed a statistically significant lower absorbance at tympanic peak pressure compared to the control group (p < 0.001). No overlap of confidence intervals between mean curves was found within the frequency range of 2000-4000 Hz.
Absorbance measures obtained by WBT were able to distinguish between MD ears and normal ears within the frequency range of 2000-4000 Hz. The results indicate that WBT potentially could be a useful and simple non-invasive diagnostic tool for MD. However, more research on the association between absorbance measures and inner ear pathologies is needed.

Cochlear Implantation Hearing Outcome in Ménière's Disease.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the hearing outcome of cochlear implantation in patients deafened by Ménière's disease.
Retrospective single-institution study.
Tertiary medical center.
Our institutional database of 1400 patients with cochlear implants was reviewed to identify cases with deafness due to Ménière's disease. Twenty-nine patients were identified: 24 with unilateral and 5 with sequential bilateral cochlear implants. Pre- and postoperative speech recognition scores and medical data were extracted from the medical record and analyzed.
Overall the mean difference between pre- and postoperative speech recognition after >1 year was 56% (95% CI, 47.08%-64.92%). The mean preoperative monosyllabic word score was 9.5%, and the mean postoperative scores at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and >1 year were 37.1%, 46.1%, 54.1%, 59.1%, and 66.8%, respectively. Cochlear implantation resulted in improved word scores in all patients regardless of prior medical or surgical treatment (endolymphatic sac, labyrinthectomy). The mean postoperative hearing improvement in patients aged <70 and ≥70 years was 65.26% (95% CI, 54.79%-75.73%) and 40.00% (95% CI, 27.22%-52.77%). Postoperative word scores in patients with bilateral cochlear implants were not significantly different between the first and second implanted ears or between the monoaural and binaural testing conditions.
Cochlear implant in patients deafened by Ménière's disease significantly improves word recognition scores regardless of whether medical or surgical treatment is used prior to implantation. The potential improvement in word recognition scores decreases after age 70 years.

Diagnosis of Menière's disease on MRI: feasibility at 1.5 Tesla.
Menière's disease (MD) is clinically characterized by the triad sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and/or aural fullness, and vertigo. Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) is the histopathological basis associated with MD, which can be demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Currently, most studies are done on a 3-T MRI scanner and to date it is believed that EH can only be demonstrated on a 3-T magnet. We report the feasibility of demonstrating EH on a 1.5-T scanner using the standard 20-channel head and neck coil and the current standard 4-h delayed intravenous gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR) sequence.
To investigate whether current standard 4-h delayed intravenous gadolinium-enhanced 3D-FLAIR imaging can demonstrate endolymphatic hydrops on a 1.5-T MRI scanner.
The 3D-FLAIR sequence was taken from a 3-T MRI protocol and tested on a volunteer patient with clinically "definite" MD, after 4-h delayed intravenous contrast injection. Good image quality was obtained after reducing both the matrix and the bandwidth, with clear demonstration of EH. Subsequently, eight more patients with unilateral disease were imaged. Five patients had "definite" MD and four had "probable" MD.
We imaged nine patients with unilateral disease and detected EH in eight of nine ears. One patient with "probable" MD did not show any abnormality, but the images were degraded by motion artifacts.
At a cost of 2 min extra scanning time compared to a 3-T scanner, EH can be confidently demonstrated with the current standard 3D-FLAIR sequence on a 1.5-T magnet.

Vestibular drop attacks in Ménière's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of frequency, correlates and consequences.
Vestibular drop attacks (VDA), also called Tumarkin otolith crises as a complication of Ménière's disease (MD) were first described in 1936. Nevertheless, a clearer understanding of their prevalence and manifestations is needed.
of this review is to determine the frequency, correlates and consequences of VDA in MD.
Three databases were searched (i.e., MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Academia). A total of 1,791 references were identified, of which 18 studies were considered eligible. There was a large variation in the definition of VDA used in the studies.
The frequency of VDA in MD leading to a fall to the ground varied from 3 to 19% in 9 hospital-based studies. In studies where a less restrictive definition of VDA included attacks with postural perturbation, tripping and near-to-fall situations was used the prevalence ranged from 50 to 72%. The pooled frequency of VDA leading to fall to the ground was 8% (95% CI 4 to 12%) in hospital-based studies. In these studies, VDA often occurred in severe and advanced MD whereas in cohort studies such connection was not found. Co-morbidity with migraine increased the likelihood of VDA occurrence in MD. In 3 studies syncope was recorded in connection to VDA with falls. In terms of clinical manifestation, audiometry, MRI, vestibular evoked muscle response measures indicated endolymphatic hydrops with involvement of the otolith system. The hearing loss was more pronounced, and balance was worse in MD patients with VDA than in those without. Injury associated with VDA was reported in only one study.
VDA is a common phenomenon in MD, occurring even in mild MD and complicated with syncope. Some preliminary evidence suggests that VDA may lead to severe injuries.

Correlation between magnetic resonance imaging classification of endolymphatic hydrops and clinical manifestations and audiovestibular test results in patients with definite Ménière's disease.
The purpose was to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification of endolymphatic hydrops with clinical features, audiological and vestibular tests in patients with definite unilateral Ménière's disease (MD).
Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in this study. The severity of the main clinical symptoms, audiovestibular tests, and MRI, performed 4 hours after intravenous injection of gadobutrol to visualize inner ear compartments, were evaluated. Endolymphatic space dilatation was assessed using Barath and Bernaerts grading systems, and the correlation between the grade of the hydrops and clinical features was evaluated.
Using the Barath system, cochlear hydrops was visualized in 81.6% of affected ears, while vestibular was 63.2%. Sensitivity increased to 94.7% using Bernaerts' modification. Vestibular hydrops involving the utricle was present only among patients with cochlear and saccular endolymphatic space dilatation. There was a significant relationship between the hearing level and the vestibular hydrops degree in the Bernaerts scale. The grade of the hydrops correlated neither with the duration of MD nor with the severity of main clinical symptoms. Our study proved MRI to be a sensitive diagnostic tool in MD. The endolymphatic hydrops' grade correlates with the hearing level, which confirms endolymphatic space dilatation's role in hearing loss.
In our study, two similar MRI grading systems were used; however, several differences were found compared to one another. The Bernaerts scale was more sensitive than the Barath scale, and several relationships between the radiological and clinical data were found. Therefore, several MRI evaluating scales and correlating them with the clinical features are needed. The increased perilymphatic enhancement of the cochlea and an extra low-grade vestibular hydrops distinguished in the Bernaerts scale may increase MD diagnosis sensitivity. Magnetic resonance findings in MD support the clinical diagnosis and may help to understand MD pathophysiology better. This study adds to the knowledge and diagnostics in MD for healthcare to improve patients' treatment.

Vertigo without cochlear symptoms: vestibular migraine or Menière disease?
Menière's disease (MD) is an inner ear disorder due to raised endolymphatic pressure (hydrops), characterized by cochlear symptoms associated with episodic vertigo. In delayed hydrops, vertigo attacks begin long after the onset of a hearing loss. Few were published on MD in which the onset of vertigo precedes cochlear symptoms by several months. Vestibular migraine (VM) is also a cause of episodic vertigo and an association between migraine and MD was proposed. Purpose of our retrospective work was to assess clinical features associated with MD in which vertigo precedes by months cochlear symptoms.
Our sample was composed by 28 subjects reporting episodic vertigo accompanied by migrainous headache or photo-phonophobia, without cochlear symptoms at onset; during follow-up, all patients developed cochlear symptoms leading to a diagnosis of MD. Results of bedside examination were compared with those of 48 VM subjects with diagnosis of VM confirmed in the follow-up. All subjects performed a bedside examination, including head-shaking, positional, and skull vibration test (SVIN).
SVIN was more frequent in MD, while positive positional test in VM. In the entire group of 72 subjects, migrainous headache during vertigo and positive positional test were correlated with a final diagnosis of VM.
Our data are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that in patients reporting only photo-phonophobia during vertigo attacks and with a positive SVIN, the clinical manifestations may be predictive for evolution toward a MD, while migrainous headache and positive positional tests more frequently are correlated to VM.

Association Between Serum Vitamin D Level and Ménière's Disease.
Ménière's disease (MD) is a well-known inner ear disease; however, the etiopathogenesis is unknown. Several factors may be involved. Meanwhile, vitamin D is reported to have an important role in inner ear physiology. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relation between vitamin D deficiency and MD.
This matched case-control study compared serum vitamin D levels between patients with definite MD and those without it.
The study was done between August 2018 and December 2019 at Ghaem University Hospital in Mashhad, Iran.
Twenty-eight patients with definite MD were matched with a group of 84 healthy individuals, regarding age, sex, body mass index, and occupation (indoor vs outdoor). The serum level of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) was measured in both groups.
The mean ± SD vitamin D level was 18.9 ± 9.7 ng/mL in the case group and 25.2 ± 13.7 ng/mL in the control group (
P
 = .027). There was a significant difference between the case and control groups according to the results of the conditional logistic regression model (
P
 = .03; adjusted odds ratio, 0.96). In the MD group, 17 (60.7%) patients were vitamin D deficient, 6 (21.4%) insufficient, and only 5 (17.9%) sufficient.
The results of this study show that serum vitamin D level in MD is significantly lower than that of the control group. However, the role of vitamin D supplementation in the management of MD needs further study.

Evaluation of vestibular function following endolymphatic sac surgery.
To evaluate objective vestibular function after endolymphatic sac surgery (ELSS) for Menière's disease (MD), using comparative vestibular function tests: videonystagmography (VNG), vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) and video head-impulse test (VHIT) METHODS: Patients with definite MD using the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) of 1995 criteria modified in 2015 and treated with ELSS (sac decompression or sac opening) were included. The primary outcome was the preservation of vestibular function, comparing pre- and postoperative vestibular function tests: VNG, VEMP, VHIT. Secondary outcomes were control of episodes of vertigo, hearing outcome using AAO-HNS criteria, and QoL using the Menière's disease outcome questionnaire.
73 patients were included in the study. We found a significant preservation of vestibular function as measured by VNG and VHIT. There was no statistical difference in the presence or absence of cervical and ocular (P13/N23 and N1/P1) waves on VEMP pre- and postoperatively. 67% of patients had good control of episodes of vertigo post-operatively, with significantly better results in the sac opening group (75%). There was no significant change in hearing postoperatively, and QoL scores were significantly improved after surgery (p < 0.0001).
Endolymphatic sac surgery (ELSS) is a conservative surgical treatment, which does not negatively impact vestibular function. It was associated with improved control of episodes of vertigo, preservation of hearing, and a clear improvement in QoL scores. Despite its pathophysiology not being fully understood, it remains a first-line procedure preserving vestibular function, for MD refractory to medical management.

Clinical high-resolution imaging and grading of endolymphatic hydrops in Hydropic Ear Disease at 1.5 T using the two-slice grading for vestibular endolymphatic hydrops in less than 10 min.
Hydropic Ear Disease (Menière) is one of the most common inner ear disorders and one of the most common causes of vertigo attacks. The underlying pathology is a distension of the endolymphatic space of the inner ear, termed endolymphatic hydrops. However, the unequivocal morphologic confirmation of ELH has been restricted to post-mortem histologic analysis until 2007, when the first clinical MR imaging report demonstrated ELH in living patients with Menière's disease at 3 T combined with intratympanic application of contrast. Imaging techniques have since then evolved further. However, a high magnetic field strength of 3 T has consistently been mandatory for reliable clinical imaging of ELH. This limitation has significantly prevented ELH imaging from being widely available across different health care systems around the world. With the aim of filling this gap, in the present study, we aim to describe the feasibility of ELH imaging at 1.5 T in clinical practice and to develop a dedicated grading system for cochlear and vestibular ELH for MR imaging at 1.5 T.
In this retrospective study, we examined 30 patients with suspected hydropic ear disease undergoing diagnostic MR imaging. Contrast agent was diluted eightfold in saline solution and unilaterally applied by intratympanic injection as described previously. MRI scanning was performed using a 16-channel head coil on a 1.5 T Achieva Philips Medical Systems Scanner using a 3D FLAIR sequence. For the cochlea, a 3-stage grading was developed. For the vestibulum, a 4-stage grading based on two axial slices was developed by analysing both the superior and the inferior part of the vestibulum. The presence of hydropic herniation of the endolymphatic space into the posterior crus of the horizontal semicircular canal was evaluated.
In all 30 patients, the perilymphatic fluid spaces of the inner ear showed clear and high signal intensity, while the endolymphatic space was not enhanced. In all patients, the vestibular endolymphatic space could be clearly delineated and differentiated from the perilymphatic space. Analysis of the cochlear endolymphatic space revealed no evidence of ELH in 7 patients, a grade 1 cochlear ELH in 11 patients and a grade 2 cochlear ELH in 12 patients. Analysis of the vestibular endoylmphatic space revealed no evidence of ELH in 8 patients, a grade 1 vestibular ELH in 5 patients, a grade 2 vestibular ELH in 9 patients and a grade 3 vestibular ELH in 8 patients. Three patients showed a clear hydropic herniation of the vestibular endolymphatic space into the posterior non-ampullated crus of the horizontal SCC.
In summary, the findings presented in this study offer an easy, reliable and universally available technique of ELH imaging for diagnostic management of patients with suspected Hydropic Ear Disease.

Patients with non-idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss show hearing improvement more often than patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
To compare inpatient treated patients with idiopathic (ISSNHL) and non-idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (NISSNHL) regarding frequency, hearing loss, treatment and outcome.
All 574 inpatient patients (51% male, median age: 60 years) with ISSNHL and NISSNHL, who were treated in federal state Thuringia in 2011 and 2012, were included retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed.
ISSNHL was diagnosed in 490 patients (85%), NISSNHL in 84 patients (15%). 49% of these cases had hearing loss due to acute otitis media, 37% through varicella-zoster infection or Lyme disease, 10% through Menière disease and 7% due to other reasons. Patients with ISSNHL and NISSNHL showed no difference between age, gender, side of hearing loss, presence of tinnitus or vertigo and their comorbidities. 45% of patients with ISSNHL and 62% with NISSNHL had an outpatient treatment prior to inpatient treatment (p < 0.001). The mean interval between onset of hearing loss to inpatient treatment was shorter in ISSNHL (7.7 days) than in NISSNHL (8.9 days; p = 0.02). The initial hearing loss of the three most affected frequencies in pure-tone average (3PTAmax) scaled 72.9 dBHL ± 31.3 dBHL in ISSNHL and 67.4 dBHL ± 30.5 dBHL in NISSNHL. In the case of acute otitis media, 3PTAmax (59.7 dBHL ± 24.6 dBHL) was lower than in the case of varicella-zoster infection or Lyme disease (80.11 dBHL ± 34.19 dBHL; p = 0.015). Mean absolute hearing gain (Δ3PTAmax
abs
) was 8.1 dB ± 18.8 dB in patients with ISSNHL, and not different in NISSNHL patients with 10.2 dB ± 17.6 dB. A Δ3PTAmax
abs
 ≥ 10 dB was reached in 34.3% of the patients with ISSNHL and to a significantly higher rate of 48.8% in NISSNHL patients (p = 0.011).
ISSNHL and NISSNHL show no relevant baseline differences. ISSNHL tends to have a higher initial hearing loss. NISSHNL shows a better outcome than ISSNHL.

Development of ebselen for the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.
The global impact of hearing loss and related auditory dysfunction including tinnitus and hyperacusis on human health is significant and growing. A substantial body of literature has found that these hearing diseases and disorders result from significant number of genetic variations and molecular mechanisms. Investigational new drugs have been tested and several approved drugs have been repurposed in clinical trials, but no therapeutics for any auditory related indication have been FDA approved. A unique investigational new drug called ebselen (SPI-1005), that is anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective, has been shown to reduce noise-induced and aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss in animals. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of SPI-1005 treatment in Meniere's disease and acute noise-induced hearing loss. SPI-1005 is currently being tested to prevent and treat tobramycin-induced ototoxicity in cystic fibrosis patients with acute lung infections. This review summarizes the published and presented data involving SPI-1005 and other drugs being tested to prevent or treat sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, recent clinical data showing the relationship between pure tone audiometry and words-in-noise test results in a Meniere's disease are presented, which may have larger implications for the field of hearing research.

Effect of advancing age on inter-frequency amplitude ratio of ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials.
The inter-frequency amplitude ratio (IFAR) is the ratio of the amplitude of 1000-Hz tone-burst evoked ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) to the 500 Hz tone-burst evoked oVEMP. Since IFAR is an amplitude-based parameter, and the amplitudes of oVEMP for different frequencies are differentially affected by ageing, IFAR could potentially be affected by the ageing process. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of ageing on the IFAR of oVEMPs.
Multiple static groups comparison.
We recorded oVEMPs for 500 Hz and 1000 Hz tone-bursts from 270 healthy individuals, each included in one of the six age groups.
The IFAR was significantly larger in the ≥60 years age group than the age groups up to 49 years. Furthermore, the IFAR in the 50-59 years age group was significantly larger than all the other age groups up to 39 years. There was a significant positive correlation between age and IFARs (
p
 < 0.01).
IFAR, a sensitive tool in the test battery for the diagnosis of Meniere's disease, is affected even in healthy individuals due to ageing; hence its cautious interpretation is recommended when evaluating adults >50 years of age who are suspected of having Meniere's disease.

Recurrent vestibulopathy: are cVEMP, oVEMP and inner ear MRI useful to distinguish patients with Menière's disease and vestibular migraine?
The aim of this study was to assess the rate of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) on MRI and the rate of otolithic dysfunction with cVEMP and oVEMP, in patients with recurrent vertigo such as Menière's disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM) and vestibular Menière's disease (vMD).
In this retrospective study, we performed 3D-FLAIR sequences with delayed acquisition in 20 MD, 20 VM and 20 vMD patients. Each subject was then assessed for the presence of EH on MRI. All patients underwent pure-tone audiometry, cVEMP and oVEMP.
In MD patients, EH was observed in 18 (90%) out of 20 patients while EH was observed in only 1 MV (5%) and 1 vMD (5%) patients. We found significant differences between groups for the presence of EH on MRI (p = 0.001). MD patients had significant higher PTA level (p < 0.001) and oVEMP impairment than MV and vMD (p = 0.08 and p = 0.06, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed for cVEMP impairment, either asymmetric ratio (p = 0.36) and 1000/500 ratio (p = 0.20).
Concerning cVEMP, we observed no significant differences between VM, vMD and MD. However, we observed higher oVEMP impairment, PTA level and EH on MRI in MD patients. We believe that MRI could be used to differentiate MD from VM patients with cochlear symptoms. However, in cases of migraine associated with recurrent vertigo and without cochlear symptoms, we believe that MRI is not a useful tool to differentiate between VM and vMD.

The relationship between cochleovestibular function tests and endolymphatic hydrops grading on MRI in patients with Menière's disease.
In this retrospective study the relationship between cochleovestibular function and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-) based classification system of endolymphatic hydrops was investigated.
Seventy-eight patients with unilateral definite Menière's disease who underwent MRI were included. The parameters of Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA), caloric irrigation test, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, and video Head Impulse Test were compared between the grades of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) and perilymphatic enhancement (PE) on MRI.
The low-frequency PTA was significantly different between cochlear EH grades I and II (p = 0.036; Grade I: mean (Standard Deviation, SD) = 51 decibel Hearing Level (dB HL) (18 dB HL); Grade II: mean (SD) = 60 dB HL (16 dB HL)), and vestibular EH grades 0 and III (p = 0.018; Grade 0: mean (SD) = 43 dB HL (21 dB HL); Grade III: mean = 60 dB HL (10 dB HL)). The ipsilateral caloric sum of ears with vestibular EH grade I (n = 6) was increased with regards to vestibular EH grades 0 (p = 0.001), II (p < 0.001), and III (p < 0.001) (Grade 0: mean (SD) = 24°/s (15°/s); Grade I: mean (SD) = 47°/s (11°/s); Grade II: mean (SD) = 21°/s (13°/s); Grade III: mean (SD) = 16°/s (8°/s)).
According to these results we can conclude that only the highest grades of cochlear and vestibular EH seem to be associated with decreased cochleovestibular functioning.

Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials.
Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMP) are commonly recorded in patients experiencing vertigo or chronic instability. This test evaluates the patient's otolith function and is often combined with both Videonystagmography and Video Head Impulse Test. VEMP is a simple, reproducible test, in the absence of any pre-existing conductive hearing loss. Cervical VEMP explore both saccular function and the inferior vestibular nerve, whereas ocular VEMP assess utricular function and the superior vestibular nerve. In combination with previously described tests, VEMP allows characterization of vertigo and provides support for the diagnosis of superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, Menière's disease, vestibular neuritis, vestibular schwannoma or idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy. A good knowledge of these electrophysiological tests is essential in order to precisely assess the presence or absence of vestibular function impairment. We describe the test recording technique and the most common pitfalls in interpretation of the results. We then outline the results observed in various diseases impacting vestibular function.

Evaluation of Serum Immunoreactivity to Common Indigenous Iranian Inhalation and Food Allergens in Patients with Meniere's Disease.
A few studies investigated the relationship between allergy and Meniere disease considering complete allergen panel. We aimed to evaluate the serum immunoreactivity in patients with Meniere's disease (MD) compared with healthy people according to common indigenous Iranian inhalation and food allergens.
Thirty-nine patients with MD referred to Rasoul Akram Hospital (Tehran, Iran) were evaluated and compared with a 41 membered control group. A panel of common inhalation and food allergens (using an immunoblotting method), as well as total immunoglobulin E (IgE) level (using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method), were checked on the patients' serum.
The mean total IgE level was 193.85 ± 175.43 IU/ml in the patients with MD and 117.61 ± 138.05 IU/ml in the control group, which was significantly higher than the other subjects in the control group (
P
 = .016). There was a significant difference between the two groups regarding inhalation allergens such as; sweet vernal grass, cultivated rye, cultivated oat, Russian thistle, goosefoot, and rough pigweed (
P
 = .01-0.038). Patients with MD reported more reactive to food allergens such as; rye flour, hazelnut, pepper, citrus mix 2, potato, strawberry, and celery allergens. There was a significant relationship between Meniere and serum immunoreactivity to inhalation and food allergens (both 
P
 = .001).
Conclusion
: Serum total IgE level in patients with MD (in both inhalation and food allergens groups) was higher than the control group, and there was a relationship between MD and immunoreactivity to common indigenous inhalation and food allergens of Iran.

[The characteristics of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in unilateral Meniere's disease patients at different clinical stages].
Objective:
This study was to retrospectively analyze the results of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials（VEMP） in unilateral Meniere's disease（MD） patients. 
Methods:
The clinical assessment results of MD patients who visited the department between January 2016 to February 2022 were reviewed. Unilateral MD patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into three groups according to clinical stages, namely, group 1（stage Ⅰ+ stage Ⅱ）, group 2（stage Ⅲ） and group 3（stage Ⅳ）. The normal value data were used to investigate the incidence of abnormal P1 and N1 latencies, abnormal P1-N1 interwave latency, and abnormal interaural amplitude asymmetry ratio（IAR）. Afterwards, considering all the above mentioned parameters, the VEMP result of each patient was graded into four levels（grade 1 means VEMP result is normal, grade 2, 3 and 4 means the VEMP result is abnormal in different degrees）. The correlation between VEMP result level and pure tone average（PTA） of MD patients in different clinical stages was examined. 
Results:
The prevalence of cVEMP in three groups was 84.2%, 70.0% and 33.3%, respectively（
P
<0.05）. The prevalence of oVEMP in three groups was 63.2%, 34.0% and 16.7%, respectively（
P
<0.05）. The incidence of abnormal P1 latency, N1 letancy and P1-N1 interwave latency of cVEMP was 21.1%, 26.3% and 24.6%, respectively. The incidence of abnormal P1 latency, N1 latency and interwave latency of oVEMP was 15.6%, 43.8% and 3.1%, respectively. The incidence of abnormal cVEMP IAR in group 1, group 2 and group 3 was 6.7%, 21.2% and 33.3%, respectively（
P
>0.05）. The incidence of abnormal IAR of oVEMP in group 1, group 2 and group 3 was 16.7%, 23.1% and 0, respectively（
P
>0.05）. cVEMP and oVEMP result levels were significantly correlated with PTA（
r
=0.339, 
P
<0.01; 
r
=0.362, 
P
<0.01 ）, respectively. 
Conclusion:
With the progression of MD, the function of saccule-vestibular inferior nerve pathway and utricle-vestibular superior nerve pathway would deteriorate in the same way as hearing.

Is endolymphatic sac surgery an efficient treatment of Menière's disease patients? A systematic literature search and meta-analysis.
The purpose of this work is to assess the treatment efficiency of endolymphatic sac surgery in patients with Menière's disease.
This study provides a systematic literature review and meta-analysis based on the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. The main inclusion criteria of the literature review were the classification categories according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines of 1985 and 1995.
An effect of 9.25 dB postoperative weighted average hearing loss in surgically treated individuals is classified as "clinically not significant" according to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 85/95. In contrast, the deterioration by 26.23% in speech comprehension is considered as "clinically significant." An improvement of functional level scale assessment by two categories and vertigo control by assessment in category B can be observed.
The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that endolymphatic sac surgery may be beneficial as a treatment for Menière's disease in terms of a positive impact on functional level scale and vertigo control while yielding a negative impact on pure tone average hearing loss and on speech comprehension.

In this article, the bi-fenestral surgical chemical labyrinthectomy is introduced as a surgical demolition technique for treating resisting incurable forms of Meniere's disease in patients aged over 70 and/or with low hearing residues refractory to medical treatment.
The results on participants fitting the inclusion criteria (n = 16) were reported using anamnesis (frequency of the crisis), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Functional Level Scale (FLS) before and after the intervention.
Vertigo control was achieved in all patients of this case series. A difference of 57 and 3.67 in mean DHI (from 68 (SD 16.7) to 11 (SD 14)) and FLS (from 4.68 (SD 0.7) to 0.1 (SD 0.3)) scores respectively were seen after an average of 16.28 months. Contextually tinnitus was reported to improve in seven patients (43.75%), aggravate in three (18.75%) and remain unchanged in the remaining six (37.5%).
Bi-fenestral surgical chemical labyrinthectomy appears a safe, immediate, and effective demolition treatment for vertigo control in a restricted class of patients affected by intractable Meniere disease.

Factors associated with spontaneous nystagmus changes in acute Ménière's disease.
Neuro-otological factors that influence changes in spontaneous nystagmus (SN) during vertigo attacks in Ménière's disease (MD) remain unclear.
To identify neuro-otological factors that might influence the initial direction of SN and the directional change of SN.
A prospective, observational study of 22 patients with definite MD to evaluate the initial direction and directional change of SN during vertigo attacks, endolymphatic hydrops (EH) volume, and the function of horizontal semicircular canal and hearing levels.
SN consistently began as irritative in 17 of 22 cases, and 9 of 17 cases showed a definite change in direction after onset. SN consistently began as paralytic in 5 of 22 cases, and 3 of 5 cases showed a definite change in direction after onset. Subjects in the irritative initial SN group had less severe degrees of hearing loss, smaller cochlear and vestibular EH volume than the paralytic initial SN group (P = 0.017, < 0.001, and 0.009, respectively). Subjects in the SN direction change group had significantly smaller maximum slow phase velocity, percentage of caloric weakness and canal paresis than the no SN direction change group (P = 0.001, 0.006, and 0.001, respectively). Simple logistic regression analysis showed that smaller EH volume was significantly associated with initial irritative SN (OR = 0.867, 95% CI 0.762-0.988, P = 0.032) and that the degree of canal paresis was negatively associated with the presence of directional change of SN (OR = 0.022, 95% CI 0.002-0.289, P = 0.004).
The morphology of EH and canal paresis may independently affect the characteristics of SN in patients with MD.

Characteristics of clinical details and endolymphatic hydrops in unilateral and bilateral Ménière's disease in a single Asian group.
To elucidate the characteristics of the clinical details and endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in bilateral Ménière's disease (BMD).
A total of 545 patients with definite MD were enrolled. Demographic variables; the age of onset; disease course; inner ear function; the coexistence of related disorders such as migraine, delayed MD, drop attacks, and autoimmune diseases; familial history; and characteristics of EH were analyzed.
In the study population, the prevalence of BMD was 15.4%. The disease duration of BMD (84.0 ± 89.6 months) was significantly longer than that of unilateral MD (UMD, 60.1 ± 94.0 months) (
P
 = 0.001). As evaluated by hearing thresholds and cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, inner ear functions were more deteriorated in BMD (
P
 < 0.05) than in UMD. The proportions of delayed MD and a family history of vertigo were significantly larger in BMD (
P
 < 0.05). EH was observed in 100% of cases on the clinically affected side and 6.1% of cases on the unaffected side.
A low prevalence of BMD, longer disease duration, higher frequencies of delayed MD, and family history of vertigo in patients with BMD were significant findings observed in the present study. All affected ears presented with EH, and a low percentage of unaffected sides presented with EH.
