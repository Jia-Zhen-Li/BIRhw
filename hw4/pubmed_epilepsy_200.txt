Uncovering the biological basis of control energy: Structural and metabolic correlates of energy inefficiency in temporal lobe epilepsy.
Network control theory is increasingly used to profile the brain's energy landscape via simulations of neural dynamics. This approach estimates the control energy required to simulate the activation of brain circuits based on structural connectome measured using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, thereby quantifying those circuits' energetic efficiency. The biological basis of control energy, however, remains unknown, hampering its further application. To fill this gap, investigating temporal lobe epilepsy as a lesion model, we show that patients require higher control energy to activate the limbic network than healthy volunteers, especially ipsilateral to the seizure focus. The energetic imbalance between ipsilateral and contralateral temporolimbic regions is tracked by asymmetric patterns of glucose metabolism measured using positron emission tomography, which, in turn, may be selectively explained by asymmetric gray matter loss as evidenced in the hippocampus. Our investigation provides the first theoretical framework unifying gray matter integrity, metabolism, and energetic generation of neural dynamics.

N-Methyl-(2S, 4R)-trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, the major bioactive compound from Sideroxylon obtusifolium, attenuates pilocarpine-induced injury in cultured astrocytes.
Glial cells have been implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy in humans and in its models. Astrocytes are lost in several brain regions after acute seizures induced by pilocarpine and may suffer hyperplasia at subsequent time points. This study investigated the effect of N-methyl-(2S,4R)-trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (NMP) on astrocytes exposed to cytotoxic concentrations of pilocarpine. Astrocytes were incubated with pilocarpine (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)=31.86 mM) for 24 h. Afterwards, they were treated with NMP at concentrations ranging from 3.12 to 100 μg/mL for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) were analyzed by flow cytometry using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and rhodamine-123 (Rho123), respectively. Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1) were measured by western blot. Pilocarpine significantly decreased cell viability and mitochondrial potential and increased ROS concentration significantly by 6.7 times compared to the control. NMP concentrations ≥25 µg/mL protected astrocytes against pilocarpine-induced injury in a concentration-dependent manner. Concomitantly, NMP reduced cytoplasmic ROS accumulation to 27.3, 24.8, and 12.3% in the groups treated with 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL NMP, respectively. NMP also protected mitochondria from pilocarpine-induced depolarization. These effects were associated with improvement of pilocarpine-induced GFAP and VDAC-1 overexpression, which are important biomarkers of astrocyte dysfunction. In conclusion, the improvement of ROS accumulation, VDAC-1 overexpression, and mitochondrial depolarization are possible mechanisms of the NMP protective action on reactive astrocytes.

Macroscopic control of cell electrophysiology through ion channel expression.
Cells convert electrical signals into chemical outputs to facilitate the active transport of information across larger distances. This electrical-to-chemical conversion requires a tightly regulated expression of ion channels. Alterations of ion channel expression provide landmarks of numerous pathological diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, or cancer. Although the activity of ion channels can be locally regulated by external light or chemical stimulus, it remains challenging to coordinate the expression of ion channels on extended spatial-temporal scales. Here, we engineered yeast 
S. cerevisiae
 to read and convert chemical concentrations into a dynamic potassium channel expression. A synthetic dual-feedback circuit controls the expression of engineered potassium channels through phytohormones auxin and salicylate to produce a macroscopically coordinated pulses of the plasma membrane potential (PMP). Our study provides a compact experimental model to control electrical activity through gene expression in eukaryotic cell populations setting grounds for various cellular engineering, synthetic biology, and potential therapeutic applications.

Splitting the Unity of Bodily Self: Toward a Comprehensive Review of Phenomenology and Psychopathology of Heautoscopy.
Heautoscopy refers to a pathological experience of visual reduplication of one's body with an ambiguous sense of self-location and a disturbing sensation of owning the illusory body. It has been recognized to occur in the course of strikingly diverse psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, space-occupying lesions, frequently of the temporal or parietal lobes, migraine, epilepsy, and depression. The literature on the subject suffers from numerous conceptual inconsistencies, scarcity of clinical data, and a lack of theoretical integratory framework that could explain the uniqueness of these symptoms.
In the study, we aimed to review all case reports on heautoscopy we could cull from the literature with an attempt to extract common factors and to foster a theoretical synthesis.
All medical and psychological databases were rigorously searched, along with reference lists of the preselected articles. First-person reports were classified according to aspects of bodily self-consciousness primarily affected: body ownership, self-location, sense of agency and consequently, collated with their etiological backgrounds.
Out of over 140 case studies, a total of only 9 patients with heautoscopy were selected as satisfying functional criteria, carefully distinguishing heautoscopy from other typically conflated full-body anomalies: autoscopy, out-of-body experience, or feeling of presence. Numerous cases turned out to be mislabeling autoscopy or out-of-body experience as heautoscopy. In addition, several problems with existing neuroimaging experiments were identified.
Phenomenological analysis revealed that from the patients' perspective, heautoscopy resembles a somatesthetic-proprioceptive illusion, rather than a cognitive delusion, and occurs much less frequently than reported. A most peculiar symptom, described by some as a sense of "bilocation," appears to stem from dynamic shifts in self-location and expanded body ownership, rather than an expanded first-person perspective. Although extremely rare in its pure form, heautoscopy gives a unique opportunity to explore the brain limits to the plasticity of bodily boundaries and the origin of the first-person spatial perspective.

The laterodorsal tegmentum and seizure regulation: Revisiting the evidence.
Electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now a routine treatment option for patients suffering from medically refractory epilepsy. DBS of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) has proven to be effective but, despite its success, few patients experience complete cessation of seizure activity. However, improving the therapy is challenging because the mechanism underlying its action remains largely unknown. One angle on improving the effectiveness of ANT stimulation is to better understand the various anatomic regions that send projections to and through this area. Here, the authors utilized a connectomic atlas of the mouse brain to better understand the regions projecting to the ANT and were particularly interested by the presence of robust cholinergic projections from the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). A subsequent review of the literature resulted in limited studies, which presented convincing evidence supporting this region's role in seizure control present in acute rodent models of epilepsy. It is thus the purpose of this paper to encourage further research into the role of the LDT on seizure mitigation, with mechanistic effects likely stemming from its cholinergic projections to the ANT. While previous studies have laid a firm foundation supporting the role of this region in modulation of seizure activity, modern scientific methodology has yet to be applied to further elucidate the mechanisms and potential benefits associated with LDT stimulation in the epileptic population.

Abnormal brain state distribution and network connectivity in a 
Mutations in the 
SYNGAP1
 gene are one of the common predictors of neurodevelopmental disorders, commonly resulting in individuals developing autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and sleep deficits. EEG recordings in neurodevelopmental disorders show potential to identify clinically translatable biomarkers to both diagnose and track the progress of novel therapeutic strategies, as well as providing insight into underlying pathological mechanisms. In a rat model of 
SYNGAP1
 haploinsufficiency in which the exons encoding the calcium/lipid binding and GTPase-activating protein domains have been deleted (
Syngap
+/Δ-GAP
 ), we analysed the duration and occurrence of wake, non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement brain states during 6 h multi-electrode EEG recordings. We find that although 
Syngap
+/Δ-GAP
 animals spend an equivalent percent time in wake and sleep states, they have an abnormal brain state distribution as the number of wake and non-rapid eye movement bouts are reduced and there is an increase in the average duration of both wake and non-rapid eye movement epochs. We perform connectivity analysis by calculating the average imaginary coherence between electrode pairs at varying distance thresholds during these states. In group averages from pairs of electrodes at short distances from each other, a clear reduction in connectivity during non-rapid eye movement is present between 11.5 Hz and 29.5 Hz, a frequency range that overlaps with sleep spindles, oscillatory phenomena thought to be important for normal brain function and memory consolidation. Sleep abnormalities were mostly uncorrelated to the electrophysiological signature of absence seizures, spike and wave discharges, as was the imaginary coherence deficit. Sleep spindles occurrence, amplitude, power and spread across multiple electrodes were not reduced in 
Syngap
+/Δ-GAP
 rats, with only a small decrease in duration detected. Nonetheless, by analysing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles, we found a reduction in high-connectivity instances between short-distance electrode pairs. Finally comparing the dynamic imaginary coherence during sleep spindles between individual electrode pairs, we identified a group of channels over the right somatosensory, association and visual cortices that have a significant reduction in connectivity during sleep spindles in mutant animals. This matched a significant reduction in connectivity during spindles when averaged regional comparisons were made. These data suggest that 
Syngap
+/Δ-GAP
 rats have altered brain state dynamics and EEG connectivity, which may have clinical relevance for 
SYNGAP1
 haploinsufficiency in humans.

Assessment of Knowledge and Attitude Regarding Epilepsy and Seizure First Aid Among Male Teachers in Mecca Region, Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study.
 ​​Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders in the pediatric age group, and teachers have a crucial role in providing appropriate epilepsy first aid. This study aims to assess the knowledge of and attitude toward epilepsy and seizure first aid among male teachers in the Mecca region, Saudi Arabia.
 This cross-sectional study used an online self-administered questionnaire. A 22-item questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms between November 18, 2021, and February 15, 2022. The study used descriptive statistics to describe the participants' characteristics, and relations were tested using the Pearson chi-square test.
 Of 385 male teachers, approximately two-thirds (57.9%) of teachers had poor knowledge of epilepsy and its first aid, 86.5% of teachers were aware that epilepsy is a neurological disorder, 67% correctly reported that during epileptic seizures, they should ensure the patient's safety and seek help, 37.7% of teachers knew when they should transfer the students to the hospital, and 45.3% who had a positive attitude towards children with epilepsy had good knowledge regarding the disease (P=.010). Only 13% had training on how to deal with seizures.
Overall knowledge of epilepsy and its first aid among schoolteachers in Mecca is still inadequate. It necessitates the inclusion of a nationwide, specialized educational epilepsy program into the teacher training curriculum.

The Impact of Magnetoencephalography-Directed Stereo-Electroencephalography Depth Electrode Implantation on Seizure Control Outcome in Children.
Introduction The use of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in localizing epileptic foci and directing surgical treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is well established in clinical practice; however, it has not yet been incorporated into the routine planning of stereo-electroencephalography (EEG) (SEEG) depth electrode trajectories during invasive intracranial evaluation for epileptic foci localization. In this study, we assess the impact of MEG-directed SEEG on seizure outcomes in a pediatric cohort. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on a single-institution cohort of pediatric patients with medically refractory epilepsy who underwent epilepsy surgery. The primary endpoint was the reduction in seizure burden as determined by dichotomized Engel scores (favorable outcome: Engel scores I and II; poor outcome: Engel scores III and IV). Results Thirty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria (24 males and 13 females). The median age at seizure onset was three years, the median age at surgery was 14.1 years, and the median follow-up length was 30.8 months. Concordance was noted in 7/10 (70%) patients who received MEG-directed SEEG. Good clinical outcomes were achieved in 70% of MEG-directed SEEG patients, compared to 59.4% in their counterparts; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.72). We noted no statistically significant association between sex, disease laterality, or age at surgery and good clinical outcomes. Conclusions Patients who underwent MEG-directed SEEG had favorable clinical outcomes, which demonstrated the practicability of this technique for determining SEEG electrode placement. Although no significant difference in clinical outcomes was obtained between the two groups, this may have been due to low statistical power. Future prospective, multi-institutional investigations to assess the benefit of MEG-directed SEEG are warranted.

Post-9/11 veterans perceptions of the pandemic: Areas of greatest impact on health and well-being.
Assess potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a subset of Post-9/11 U.S. Veterans included in a study of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE).
Two measures were added to a structured health interview for Veterans during temporary pandemic research shutdown: a validated health questionnaire [1] previously completed by survey, and a semi-structured instrument developed to assess whether pandemic conditions affected responses to the health questionnaire and identify unique impacts. Interviews were conducted between August 2020 - February 2021. Scaled items were calculated and 
t
-tests used to compare results. Open-ended items were coded using thematic analyses.
Veterans identified eight major areas of impact with negative and positive impacts: mental health, family, social, work/employment, access to resources, physical health, finances, and education.
The temporary shut-down of a large health study for Post-9/11 Veterans provided an opportunity to devise an instrument to assess COVID-19's impact on health and well-being. The instrument was accepted as of the first Veteran instrument in a pandemic SDOH research repository [2], and is being used in other studies.
This study highlights the need to assess and understand interrelated relationships of factors impacting health and well-being, especially as COVID-19 moves from pandemic to endemic with reverberating effects across multiple social determinants of health (SDOH).

Role of tRNA-Derived Fragments in Neurological Disorders: a Review.
tRFs are small tRNA derived fragments that are emerging as novel therapeutic targets and regulatory molecules in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders. These are derived from precursor or mature tRNA, forming different subtypes that have been reported to be involved in neurological disorders like stroke, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, Parkinson's, MELAS, autism, and Huntington's disorder. tRFs were earlier believed to be random degradation debris of tRNAs. The significant variation in the expression level of tRFs in disease conditions indicates their salient role as key players in regulation of these disorders. Various animal studies are being carried out to decipher their exact role; however, more inputs are required to transform this research knowledge into clinical application. Future investigations also call for high-throughput technologies that could help to bring out the other hidden aspects of these entities. However, studies on tRFs require further research efforts to overcome the challenges posed in quantifying tRFs, their interactions with other molecules, and the exact mechanism of function. In this review, we are abridging the current understanding of tRFs, including their biogenesis, function, relevance in clinical therapies, and potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of these neurological disorders.

Graph-generative neural network for EEG-based epileptic seizure detection via discovery of dynamic brain functional connectivity.
Dynamic complexity in brain functional connectivity has hindered the effective use of signal processing or machine learning methods to diagnose neurological disorders such as epilepsy. This paper proposed a new graph-generative neural network (GGN) model for the dynamic discovery of brain functional connectivity via deep analysis of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from various regions of a patient's scalp. Brain functional connectivity graphs are generated for the extraction of spatial-temporal resolution of various onset epilepsy seizure patterns. Our supervised GGN model was substantiated by seizure detection and classification experiments. We train the GGN model using a clinically proven dataset of over 3047 epileptic seizure cases. The GGN model achieved a 91% accuracy in classifying seven types of epileptic seizure attacks, which outperformed the 65%, 74%, and 82% accuracy in using the convolutional neural network (CNN), graph neural networks (GNN), and transformer models, respectively. We present the GGN model architecture and operational steps to assist neuroscientists or brain specialists in using dynamic functional connectivity information to detect neurological disorders. Furthermore, we suggest to merge our spatial-temporal graph generator design in upgrading the conventional CNN and GNN models with dynamic convolutional kernels for accuracy enhancement.

Correlation between brain functional connectivity and neurocognitive function in patients with left frontal glioma.
The association between neurocognitive function (NCF) impairment and brain cortical functional connectivity in glioma patients remains unclear. The correlations between brain oscillatory activity or functional connectivity and NCF measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale full-scale intelligence quotient scores (WAIS FSIQ), the Wechsler Memory Scale-revised general memory scores (WMS-R GM), and the Western aphasia battery aphasia quotient scores (WAB AQ) were evaluated in 18 patients with left frontal glioma using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Current source density (CSD) and lagged phase synchronization (LPS) were analyzed using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Although 2 and 2 patients scored in the borderline range of WAIS FSIQ and WMS-R GM, respectively, the mean WAIS FSIQ, WMS-R GM, and WAB AQ values of all patients were within normal limits, and none had aphasia. In the correlation analysis, lower WMS-R GM was associated with a higher LPS value between the right anterior prefrontal cortex and the left superior parietal lobule in the beta1 band (13-20 Hz, R = - 0.802, P = 0.012). These findings suggest that LPS evaluated by scalp EEG is associated with memory function in patients with left frontal glioma and mild NCF disorders.

Development of a core outcome set for quality of life for adults with drug-resistant epilepsy: A multi-stakeholder Delphi consensus study.
In 2017, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) convened the AAN Quality Measurement Set working group to define the improvement and maintenance of quality of life (QOL) as a key outcome measure in epilepsy clinical practice. A core outcome set (COS), defined as an accepted, standardized set of outcomes that should be minimally measured and reported in an area of healthcare research and practice, has not previously been defined for QOL in adult epilepsy.
A cross-sectional Delphi consensus study was employed to attain consensus from patients and caregivers on the QOL outcomes that should be minimally measured and reported in epilepsy clinical practice. Candidate items were compiled from QOL scales recommended by the AAN 2017 Quality Measurement Set. Inclusion criteria to participate in the Delphi study were adults with drug-resistant epilepsy diagnosed by a physician, no prior diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or a cognitive and/or developmental disability, or caregivers of patients meeting these criteria.
A total of 109 people satisfied inclusion/exclusion criteria and took part in Delphi round 1 (patients, n=95, 87.2%; caregivers, n=14, 12.8%), and 55 people from round 1 completed round 2 (patients, n=38, 69.1%; caregivers, n=17, 30.9%). One-hundred-and-three people took part in the final consensus round. Consensus was attained by patients/caregivers on a set of 36 outcomes that should minimally be included in the QOL COS. Of these, 32 of the 36 outcomes (88.8%) pertained to areas outside of seizure frequency and severity.
Using patient-centered Delphi methodology, this study defines the first COS for QOL measurement in clinical practice for adults with drug-resistant epilepsy. This set highlights the diversity of factors beyond seizure frequency and severity that impact QOL in epilepsy.

Erector spinae plane block for thoracoscopy in a paediatric patient.
We present the case of a 9 year old patient with a clinical history of epilepsy and various hospitalizations due to aspirative broncopneumonia among others, who was admitted to our hospital because of septic shock secondary to pneumonia of the lower left lobule associated with a parapneumonic pleural effusion and a complicated clinical course. During her stay, the patient undergoes surgical debridement using video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) under general anaesthesia and the hydropneumothorax is drained. For the procedure an ecoguided erector spinae plane block is performed and combined with general anaesthesia. On one hand this block permitted reduction of perioperative opioid administration and improved the patient's respiration, on the other hand it permitted avoiding the use of drugs, which can lower seizure threshold and increase the risk of convulsions. This case illustrates the importance of locoregional anaesthesia, a technique on the rise in the field of paediatric anaesthesia.

Neurosurgery in feline epilepsy, including clinicopathology of feline epilepsy syndromes.
Feline epilepsy is treated with antiseizure medications, which achieves fair to good seizure control. However, a small subset of feline patients with drug-resistant epilepsy requires alternative therapies. Furthermore, approximately 50% of cats with epileptic seizures are diagnosed with structural epilepsy with or without hippocampal abnormality and may respond to surgical intervention. The presence of hippocampal pathology and intracranial tumors is a key point to consider for surgical treatment. This review describes feline epilepsy syndrome and epilepsy-related pathology, and discusses the indications for and availability of neurosurgery, including lesionectomy, temporal lobectomy with hippocampectomy, and corpus callosotomy, for cats with different epilepsy types.

Unmet needs and perspectives in management of drug resistant focal epilepsy: An Italian study.
This study aimed to evaluate the consensus level between a representative group of Italian neurologists and people with Drug-Resistant Epilepsy (DRE) regarding a series of statements about different aspects involved in the management of epilepsy to identify the unmet needs of the People with Epilepsy (PwE) and the future perspectives for the management of this disease. This observational study was conducted using a classic Delphi technique. A 19-statement questionnaire was administered anonymously through an online platform to a panel of expert clinicians and a panel of PwE, analyzing three main topics of interest: drug resistance, access to care, and PwE's experience. The consensus was achieved on 8 of the 19 statements administered to the panel of medical experts and on 4 of the 14 submitted to the panel of PwE, particularly on the definition of DRE and its consequences on treatment, Quality of Life (QoL), and autonomy of PwE. Most of the items, however, did not reach a consensus and highlighted the lack of a shared univocal view on some topics, such as accessibility to care throughout the country and the role of emerging tools such as telemedicine, narrative medicine, and digital devices. In many cases, the two panels expressed different views on the statements. The results outlined many fields of possible intervention, such as the need for educational initiatives targeted at physicians and PwE - for example, regarding telemedicine, digital devices, and narrative medicine - as well as the spread of better knowledge about epilepsy among the general population, in order to reduce epilepsy stigma. Institutions, moreover, could take a cue from this survey to develop facilities aimed at enhancing PwE's autonomy and promoting more equal access to care throughout the country.

The accuracy of a novel self-tapping bone fiducial marker for frameless robot-assisted stereo-electro-encephalography implantation and registration techniques.
We aimed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of a novel self-tapping bone fiducial as a registration technique for stereo-electro-encephalography (SEEG) implantation.
Each patient was installed with five bone fiducial markers. All procedures were performed using the same Sinovation robot system. The accuracy was determined by calculating the target point error (TPE) and the entry point error (EPE) of electrodes.
Fourteen patients underwent SEEG implantation surgery; and the average installation time of the markers per patient was 86.1 s. In the operating theatre, the average registration time was 206.6 s, and the average registration error was 0.18 mm. The average TPE of 174 electrodes was 1.98 mm and the average EPE was 0.88 mm.
Our study provided a bone fiducial marker installation and registration technique that was convenient and fast, highly accurate in registration, and highly tolerated by patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Exoscope improves visualization and extent of hippocampal resection in temporal lobectomy.
Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) is a safe and well-validated procedure in the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but is a challenging technique to master and still confers a risk of morbidity and mortality due to the complex anatomy of the mesial temporal lobe structures. Automated robotic 3D exoscopes have been developed to address limitations traditionally associated with microscopic visualization, allowing for ergonomic, high-definition 3D visualization with hands-free control of the robot. Given the potential advantages of using such a system for visualization of complex anatomy seen during mesial structure resection in ATL, this group sought to investigate impact on the percentage of hippocampal resection in both exoscope and microscope guided procedures.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 20 consecutive patients undergoing standard ATL for treatment of medically refractory TLE at our institution. Using pre-operative and post-operative imaging, the coronal plane cuts in which either the head, body, or tail of the hippocampus appeared were counted. The number of cuts in which the hippocampus appeared were multiplied by slice thickness to estimate hippocampal length.
Mean percentage of hippocampal resection was 61.1 (SD 13.1) and 76.5 (SD 6.5) for microscope and exoscope visualization, respectively (p = 0.0037).
Use of exoscope for mesial resection during ATL has provided good visualization for those in the operating room and the potential for a safe increase in hippocampal resection in our series. Further investigation of its applications should be evaluated to see if it will improve outcomes.

Semi-automatic interictal electric source localization based on long-term EEG monitoring: a prospective study.
Electric source imaging (ESI) of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) has shown its significant yield in numerous studies, however, its implementation in most centers is labor- and cost intensive. Semi-automatic ESI analysis (SAEA) has been proposed as alternative and previously shown its benefit. Computer assisted automatic spike cluster retrieval, averaging and source localization is carried out for each cluster and is then reviewed by an expert neurophysiologist, to determine their relevance for the individual case. Here we examine its yield in a prospective single center study.
Between 2017 and 2022, 122 patients underwent SAEA. Inclusion criteria for the current study were: unifocal epilepsy disorder, epilepsy surgery with curative purpose, post-operative follow-up of 2 years or more. All patients had continuous video-EEG monitoring with 37 scalp electrodes, which underwent SAEA. Forty patients matched our inclusion criteria.
Twenty patients required intracranial monitoring, 11 were MRI-negative. Mean duration of analyzed EEG was 4.3 days (+/- 3.1 days), containing a mean of 12'749 detected IEDs (+/- 22'324). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of SAEA for localizing the epileptogenic focus of the entire group was 74.3%, 80% and 75%, respectively, leading to an OR of 11.5 to become seizure-free if the source was included in the resection volume (p< 0.05). In patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy our results indicated an accuracy of 68.6. (OR 4.7). For MRI- negative patients (N=11) and patients requiring intracranial EEG (N=20), we found a similarly high accuracy of 77% (OR 8.1) and 74% (OR 14.6), respectively.
In this prospective study, SAEA of long-term video-EEG, spanning several days, we found excellent localizing information and a high yield, even in difficult patient groups. This compares favorably to HD-ESI, most likely due to marked improved signal-to-noise ratio of the averaged IEDs. We propose to include ESI, or SAEA, in the work-up of all patients who are referred for epilepsy surgery.

High Frequency Oscillations (250-500Hz) in Animal Models of Alzheimer's Disease and Two Animal Models of Epilepsy.
To test the hypothesis that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 250 and 500Hz occur in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus are not unique to epilepsy.
Experiments were conducted in three mouse models of AD: Tg2576 mice that simulate a form of familial AD, presenilin 2 knock-out (PS2KO) mice, and the Ts65Dn model of Down's syndrome. We recorded HFOs using wideband (0.1-500Hz, 2kHz) intra-hippocampal and cortical surface EEG at 1month until 24months-old during wakefulness, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Interictal spikes (IIS) and seizures were also analyzed for the possible presence of HFOs. Comparisons were made to the intra-hippocampal kainic acid and pilocarpine models of epilepsy.
We describe for the first time that hippocampal and cortical HFOs are a new EEG abnormality in AD mouse models. HFOs occurred in all transgenic mice but no controls. They were also detectable as early as 1month of age and prior to amyloid-β plaque neuropathology. HFOs were most frequent during SWS (vs. REM or wakefulness). Notably, HFOs in the AD and epilepsy models were indistinguishable in both spectral frequency and duration. HFOs also occurred during IIS and seizures in the AD models, although with altered spectral properties compared to isolated HFOs.
Our data demonstrate that HFOs, an epilepsy biomarker with high translational value, are not unique to epilepsy and thus not disease specific. Our findings also strengthen the idea of hyperexcitability in AD and its significant overlap with epilepsy. HFOs in AD mouse models may serve as an EEG biomarker which is detectable from the scalp and thus amenable to non-invasive detection in people at risk for AD.

Glycolysis regulates neuronal excitability via lactate receptor, HCA1R.
Repetitively firing neurons during seizures accelerate glycolysis to meet energy demand, which leads to the accumulation of extracellular glycolytic by-product lactate. Here, we demonstrate that lactate rapidly modulates neuronal excitability in times of metabolic stress via the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor type 1 (HCA1R) to modify seizure activity. The extracellular lactate concentration, measured by a biosensor, rose quickly during brief and prolonged seizures. In two epilepsy models, mice lacking HCA1R (lactate receptor) were more susceptible to developing seizures. Moreover, HCA1R deficient (knock out, KO) mice developed longer and more severe seizures than wild-type littermates (WT). Lactate perfusion decreased neuronal tonic and phasic activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in GCAMP7 imaging experiments. HCA1R agonist, 3Cl-HBA, reduced the activity of CA1 neurons in HCA1R WT but not in KO mice. In patch-clamp recordings, both lactate and 3CL-HBA hyperpolarized CA1 pyramidal neurons. HCA1R activation reduced the spontaneous EPSC frequency and altered the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs in HCA1R WT but not in KO mice, suggesting it diminished presynaptic release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Overall, our studies demonstrate that excessive neuronal activity accelerates glycolysis to generate lactate, which translocates to the extracellular space to slow neuronal firing and inhibit excitatory transmission via HCA1R. These studies may identify novel anticonvulsant target and seizure termination mechanisms.

[Treatment of medical comorbidities in dementia].
Comorbidities such as epilepsy, pain, vascular risk factors and infections are common in patients with dementia disorders. The relationship between comorbidities and dementia is complex, and diagnosis and management can be met with barriers due to e.g. lack of insight. An individualized approach is necessary, taking the dementia disorder and other relevant circumstances into consideration. Correct and timely management of comorbidities will help to improve quality of life and slow progression of the cognitive decline.

Localizing epileptogenic network from SEEG using non-linear correlation, mutual information and graph theory analysis.
The key challenge in epilepsy surgery is precise localization and removal of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) from the brain. Localization of the epileptogenic network by visual analysis of intracranial EEG is extremely difficult. In this retrospective study, we used interictal connectivity and graph theory analysis on intracranial EEG to better delineate the epileptogenic zone. Patients who underwent surgery for drug-refractory mesial temporal and neocortical epilepsy were included. Computational measures, such as h
2
 nonlinear correlation and mutual information, were used to estimate the interdependency of intracranial EEGs. We observed that the Out-Degree, Out-Strength, and Betweenness centrality (graph properties) were the best predictors of EZ. From the results, we also found that graph properties with a normalized value above 0.75 were found to be a useful measure to localize the EZ with a sensitivity of 87.88 and a specificity of 87.13. Our results also validate that frequently occurring types of interictal fast discharges (IFD) with connectivity measures and graph properties can better localize the EZ. We foresee graph theory analysis of interictal intracranial EEG data can help precise localization of EZ for cortical resection as well as in minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation of epileptogenic hubs. Further, prospective validation is required for clinical use.

Functional characterization of a 
Genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a type of epileptic syndrome closely related to heredity factors, which can be caused by gene mutations. However, it still remains unclear how these mutations result in seizures. Previously, we identified a new heterozygous missense mutation of the 
KCNAB3
 gene, H258R, in the GEFS+ family; the electric currents of the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells co-expressing Kvβ3 (H258R) and Kv1.1 showed obvious inactivation. This study sought to examine the effects of this mutation on the potassium channels in the mammalian brain.
Mutant mice were generated by introducing the human H258R missense mutation within exon 10 at an equivalent position in the mouse 
KCNAB3
 gene via CRISPR/Cas9 and homologous recombination. A patch clamp was used to detect the potassium currents in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region of the mutant mice. The total potassium currents of the pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of 
KCNAB3
 [wild-type (WT)] and 
KCNAB3
 (H258R) adult mice were recorded with increased voltage.
We found a decreased total potassium current in the H258R group but no significant differences at a maximum voltage (+80 mV; P>0.05).
These results suggest that the 
KCNAB3
 mutation reduced hippocampal potassium currents in this mouse model.

Acute liver failure associated with lamotrigine in children with epilepsy: A report of two cases and thoughts on pharmacogenomics.
Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a rare and life-threatening clinical syndrome for which drug-induced liver injury is a cause. Lamotrigine (LTG) is generally a safe and effective antiseizure medication, and PALF related to LTG has rarely been reported. Here, we describe two cases of PALF associated with LTG in children with epilepsy. In both patients, LTG was used in combination with valproic acid at an initial dose exceeding the recommended dose, which increased the risk of adverse reactions. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LTG were selected for pharmacogenomic testing. However, the results revealed that genotypes of the patients had variable effects on the serum concentration and therapeutic responsiveness of LTG and therefore did not explain the clinical manifestations well. The findings of this case report caution clinicians to be aware of the risk of liver failure when using antiseizure medication in polytherapy, especially LTG in combination with valproic acid. When administered to children, the recommended dosage of LTG should be strictly followed. Further pharmacogenomic studies are needed to help improve the efficacy and safety of epilepsy treatment in the future.

Traumatic maxillofacial injuries: Patterns, outcomes, and long-term follow-up of a military cohort.
Maxillofacial trauma poses a distinct challenge on the modern battlefield, and data on its long-term implications are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate maxillofacial injury characteristics, outcomes, and complications along the continuum of care among hospitalized military personnel from the pre-hospital setting through long-term rehabilitation.
A registry-based study was undertaken of three national trauma and rehabilitation registries: The Israel Defense Forces Trauma Registry (IDF-TR), which records pre-hospital data. The Israeli National Trauma Registry for in-hospital data and the Israel Ministry of Defense Rehabilitation Department (MOD-RD) registry contain long-term disability data. The cohort comprised IDF soldiers who suffered maxillofacial injuries between 1997 and 2020.
A total of 672 patients with maxillofacial injuries were included in the study, and 6.4% of all trauma admissions were related to maxillofacial injuries. Of these, 366 (54%) were injured in non-military (NMC) circumstances, and 306 (46%) were wounded in military circumstances (MC). The mechanisms of injury were mainly traffic-related among the NMC group compared with an explosion in the MC group. Maxillofacial fractures were frequently associated with traumatic brain injuries with higher rates in the NMC group than in the MC group (55% vs. 30%, p < .001). In a multivariate analysis, zygomatic and orbital fractures were associated with higher odds of concomitant head injury. The most common categories of long-term disability included central nervous system disorders, skull injuries, epilepsy, hearing impairment, ophthalmologic conditions, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Maxillofacial injuries are often associated with concomitant traumatic brain injury. Long-term disabilities associated with these injuries included the central nervous system, hearing, ophthalmologic impairments, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Diffusion tensor imaging changes in patients with glioma-associated seizures.
Structural white matter changes associated with certain epilepsy subtypes have been demonstrated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This observational study aims to identify potential water diffusion abnormalities in glioma patients with associated seizures.
Two cohorts from two centers were analyzed independently: (A) Prospectively recruited patients diagnosed with glioma who received preoperative DTI to measure mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in regions-of-interest (ROIs) including the marginal tumor zone (TU), adjacent peritumoral white matter as well as distant ipsilateral and contralateral white matter and cortex. Data were compared between patients with and without seizures and tested for statistical significance. (B) A retrospective cohort using an alternative technical approach sampling ROIs in contrast enhancement, necrosis, non-enhancing tumor, marginal non-enhancing tumor zone, peritumoral tissue, edema and non-tumorous tissue.
(A) The prospective study cohort consisted of 23 patients with 12 (52.2%) presenting with a history of seizures. There were no significant seizure-associated differences in MD or FA for non-tumor white matter or cortical areas. MD-TU was significantly lower in patients with seizures (p = 0.005). (B) In the retrospective cohort consisting of 46 patients with a seizure incidence of 50.0%, significantly decreased normalized values of MD were observed for non-enhancing tumor regions of non-glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cases in patients with seizures (p = 0.022).
DTI analyses in glioma patients demonstrated seizure-associated diffusion restrictions in certain tumor-related areas. No other structural abnormalities in adjacent or distant white matter or cortical regions were detected.

Epileptiform activity induced metaplasticity impairs bidirectional plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 synapses via GluN2B NMDA receptors.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of epilepsy in humans. Cognitive impairment and memory consolidation problems are common among TLE patients. To understand the changes in the cellular process of memory in TLE, we studied the long-term depression (LTD) in Schaffer-collateral (Sc) CA1 synapses in an epilepsy model. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was investigated in patient samples and animal models by several groups, but LTD was not studied with the same interest in epilepsy research. Here we induced epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices using magnesium-free high-potassium (7.5 mM K +) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (HK-ACSF) and characterized the LTD in Sc-CA1 synapses. We found that epileptiform activity abolished/impaired LTD and depotentiation in the Sc-CA1 synapses. In control slices, application of NMDA (30 μM for 3 min) induced chemical LTD (c-LTD) in Sc-CA1 synapses, whereas epileptiform activity induced slices showed slow onset potentiation. Induction of LTD using 1 Hz, 900 pulses yielded a similar outcome as c-LTD. Both forms of LTD were NMDA receptor dependent. In addition, we found that the polarity changes in the synaptic plasticity in epileptiform-induced slices were blocked by GluN2B antagonists ifenprodil and Ro 25-6981. Our data suggest that epileptiform-induced metaplasticity inhibits LTD in Sc-CA1 synapses. We provide new insight into the cellular mechanism of memory formation during epilepsy.

Temporal Dynamics of Competition between Statistical Learning and Episodic Memory in Intracranial Recordings of Human Visual Cortex.
The function of long-term memory is not just to reminisce about the past, but also to make predictions that help us behave appropriately and efficiently in the future. This predictive function of memory provides a new perspective on the classic question from memory research of why we remember some things but not others. If prediction is a key outcome of memory, then the extent to which an item generates a prediction signifies that this information already exists in memory and need not be encoded. We tested this principle using human intracranial EEG as a time-resolved method to quantify prediction in visual cortex during a statistical learning task and link the strength of these predictions to subsequent episodic memory behavior. Epilepsy patients of both sexes viewed rapid streams of scenes, some of which contained regularities that allowed the category of the next scene to be predicted. We verified that statistical learning occurred using neural frequency tagging and measured category prediction with multivariate pattern analysis. Although neural prediction was robust overall, this was driven entirely by predictive items that were subsequently forgotten. Such interference provides a mechanism by which prediction can regulate memory formation to prioritize encoding of information that could help learn new predictive relationships.
Significance Statement:
When faced with a new experience, we are rarely at a loss for what to do. Rather, because many aspects of the world are stable over time, we rely on past experiences to generate expectations that guide behavior. Here we show that these expectations during a new experience come at the expense of memory for that experience. From intracranial recordings of visual cortex, we decoded what humans expected to see next in a series of photographs based on patterns of neural activity. Photographs that generated strong neural expectations were more likely to be forgotten in a later behavioral memory test. Prioritizing the storage of experiences that currently lead to weak expectations could help improve these expectations in future encounters.

Hemostatic and Thrombotic Considerations in the Diagnosis and Management of Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke: A Narrative Review.
Although rare in children, arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is associated with increased mortality and neurological morbidity. The incidence of AIS after the neonatal period is approximately 1-2/100,000/year, with an estimated mortality of 3-7%. A significant proportion of children surviving AIS experience life-long neurological deficits including hemiparesis, epilepsy, and cognitive delays. The low incidence of childhood AIS coupled with atypical clinical-presentation and lack of awareness contribute to delay in diagnosis and consequently, the early initiation of treatment. While randomized-clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of reperfusion therapies including thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy in appropriately-selected adult patients, similar data for children are unavailable. Consequently, clinical decisions surrounding reperfusion therapy in childhood AIS are either extrapolated from adult data or based on local experience. The etiology of childhood AIS is multifactorial, often occurring in the setting of both acquired and congenital risk-factors including thrombophilia. While multiple studies have investigated the association of thrombophilia with incident childhood AIS, its impact on stroke recurrence and therefore duration and intensity of antithrombotic therapy is less clear. Despite these limitations, a significant progress has been made over the last decade in the management of childhood AIS. This progress can be attributed to international consortiums, and in selected cohorts to federally-funded clinical trials. In this narrative review, the authors have systematically appraised the literature and summarize the hemostatic and thrombotic considerations in the diagnosis and management of childhood AIS focusing on the evidence supporting reperfusion therapies, relevance of thrombophilia testing, and duration and drug choices for secondary-prophylaxis.

Psychiatric symptoms predict drug-resistant epilepsy in newly treated patients.
Literature on the complex interrelationships between psychiatric symptoms and drug resistance in newly treated patients with epilepsy (PWE) is lacking. We aimed to determine whether psychiatric symptoms are predictive of the development of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in newly treated patients.
Newly treated PWE were psychiatrically evaluated at enrolment and were followed for 24 months to determine the occurrence of DRE. The impacts of depressive and anxiety symptoms on the development of DRE were investigated using the Cox proportional hazard model.
A total of 217 patients were included in the final analysis. DRE was diagnosed in 26.7% of patients (n=58). In univariate analysis, depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified as risk factors for the development of DRE. In multivariate analyses, depressive symptoms were a significant independent predictor of DRE (HR: 3.253, 95% CI: 1.643-6.441; p = 0.001). Additionally, the probability of developing DRE was 5.219 times higher in patients with both depressive and anxiety symptoms than in patients without depressive or anxiety symptoms (HR: 5.219, 95% CI: 2.716-10.029; p<0.001).
In conclusion, psychiatric symptoms provide prognostic information regarding the occurrence of DRE in patients newly treated with ASMs. Our findings support the need for prospective studies to investigate whether psychiatric treatment reduces the risk of developing DRE in these patients.

Effects and safety of high-frequency rTMS in acute intracerebral hemorrhage patients: A pilot study.
Although high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) in chronic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is beneficial, it has been poorly investigated in rTMS for acute ICH. Our aim is to investigate the effects and safety of rTMS in acute spontaneous ICH.
We prospectively performed HF-rTMS on consecutive patients with ICH within 24 h from onset between April 2019 and August 2021. The inclusion criterion was (1) persistent paralysis, with an NIHSS scale of 1 or higher for at least 3 days after onset. The exclusion criteria were (1) cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar ICH, (2) disturbance of consciousness, and (3) over 80 years of age. For the purpose of comparison, we used a conventional rehabilitation group whose patients met the same criteria between April 2016 and March 2019. We evaluated incidence of epilepsy and exacerbation of the NIHSS score in the rTMS group. We also compared the two groups regarding clinical background and outcome.
Enrolled in the study were a total of 44 patients. Of the patients, 22 (50%) were in the rTMS group. The median (IQR) time from onset to the start of rTMS was 9 (6-12) days. There were no cases of epilepsy or exacerbation of NIHSS after the start of rTMS. Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of between 0 and 2) at 3 months was frequently observed in the rTMS group (73% vs 27%, p = 0.006). HF-rTMS was independently associated with favorable outcome at 3 months (OR = 11.5, 95% CI = 2.194-60.447, p = 0.004).
HF-rTMS may be safe and effective in acute ICH patients.

Glyceryl triacetate feeding in mice increases plasma acetate levels but has no anticonvulsant effects in acute electrical seizure models.
Acetate has been shown to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. It is oxidized by astrocytes and can thus provide auxiliary energy to the brain in addition to glucose. Therefore, we hypothesized that it may protect against seizures, which is investigated here by feeding glyceryl triacetate (GTA), to provide high amounts of acetate without raising sodium or acid levels.
CD1 male mice were fed controlled diets with or without GTA for up to three weeks. Body weights, blood glucose levels, plasma short-chain fatty acid levels, and other hematological parameters were monitored. Seizure thresholds were determined in 6 Hz and maximal electroshock seizure threshold (MEST) tests. Antioxidant capacities were evaluated in the cerebral cortex and plasma using a ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay.
Body weight gain was similar with both diets with and without GTA in two experiments. Glyceryl triacetate-fed groups showed 2-3- and 1.6-fold increased acetate and propionate levels in plasma, respectively. Glucose levels were unaltered in blood collected from the tail tip but increased in trunk blood. No differences were found in the activity of cerebral cortex acetyl-CoA synthetase. In the 6 Hz threshold test, seizure thresholds were lower by 3 mA and 2.4 mA after 8 and 14 days, respectively, in the GTA compared to the control diet-fed group, but showed no difference on day 16, showing that GTA has small, but inconsistent proconvulsant effects in this model. In MEST tests, a slightly increased seizure threshold (1 mA) was found on day 19 in the GTA-fed group, but not in another experiment on day 21. There were no differences in antioxidant capacity in plasma or cortex between the two groups.
Glyceryl triacetate feeding showed no antioxidant effects nor beneficial changes in acute electrical seizure threshold mouse models, despite its ability to increase plasma acetate levels.

Psychiatric comorbidities among people with epilepsy: A population-based assessment in disadvantaged communities.
Psychiatric disorders are frequent among people with epilepsy but often under-recognized. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders in low- and low-middle-income countries (LMICs) are challenging.
This cross-sectional survey included people recruited during a community epilepsy screening program involving 59,509 individuals from poor communities in Ludhiana in Northwest India. Adults (age ≥18 years) with confirmed epilepsy on antiseizure medications were screened for depression and anxiety using the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) twice over two years of follow-up. They were later interviewed for symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, which was then confirmed by assessments by an experienced psychiatrist.
Of the 240 people with confirmed epilepsy, 167 (70%) were adults, of whom, 116 (70%) eventually participated in the study. The NDDI-E with a cut-off of 15 identified depression in 14 (12%) of 116 people after one year of follow-up and 17 (15%) at two years. The GAD-7 using a cut-off of 6 identified 22 (19%) at one year and 32 (28%) with anxiety at two years. The area under the curves for NDDI-E was estimated as 0.62 (
95%
CI, 0.51-0.73; SE: 0.06; p = 0.04) and for GAD-7 as 0.62 (
95%
CI, 0.46-0.78; SE: 0.08; p = 0.12). Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale identified 63 (54%) people with psychiatric symptoms, for whom, a psychiatric diagnosis was confirmed in 60 (52%). A psychiatric diagnosis was associated with education below high school [Odds Ratio (OR): 2.59, 
95%
CI, 1.12-5.1; p = 0.03], later age of seizure onset (OR, 1.05, 
95%
CI: 1.0-1.10; p = 0.04), seizure frequency of at least one/year at enrolment (OR, 2.36, 
95%
CI: 1.0-5.58; p = 0.05) and the use of clobazam (OR, 5.09, 
95%
CI, 1.40-18.42; p = 0.01).
Depression and anxiety are common in people with epilepsy. Our findings underscore the low yields of screening instruments, NDDI-E and GAD-7, and comparatively better professionally-administered diagnostic assessments in resource-limited settings in LMICs. Moreover, previously established cut-offs do not apply to the community studied.

Endoscopic transcortical expanded transforaminal transvenous transchoroidal approach to third ventricle lesion resection using an endoport.
To investigate the clinical experience and application value of endoscopic resection of lesions in and around the third ventricle using a transcortical expanded transforaminal transvenous transchoroidal approach with an endoport.
Clinical data and follow-up results of seven patients who underwent the removal of lesions in the third ventricle and its adjacent area with an endoport-guided endoscopic system from January 2018 to December 2020 in the Department of Neurosurgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, were analyzed retrospectively. Two other patients from the Affiliated Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University and the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, respectively, were included in the analysis.
A total of nine cases of third ventricle tumors were included in the study, including six women and three men, with an average age of 37.8 years (4-84 years old) and a follow-up time of 6-44 months. These nine tumor cases included two pilocytic astrocytomas, one diffuse midline glioma (H3 K27-altered), two craniopharyngiomas, two choroid plexus (CP) papillomas, one germinoma, and one pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation. Total resection was completed in eight cases, with one near-total resection. There were no complications related to the surgical approach, such as epilepsy, aphasia, or hemiplegia.
The endoscope transcortical expanded transforaminal transvenous transchoroidal approach using an endoport can safely and effectively remove third ventricle lesions. This approach can reach a wide area, from the anterior to the posterior third ventricle.

Predictive factors for the development of epilepsy after ischemic stroke.
Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of epilepsy in adults. The incidence of post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is approximately 7%. Risk factors are higher stroke severity, cortical localization, higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission and acute symptomatic seizures. We analyzed the predictive factors of PSE development in our population.
Retrospective observational cohort of adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with ischemic stroke assessed between January 2012 and June 2020. Patients with personal history of epilepsy and potentially epileptogenic structural injury other than acute or chronic stroke were excluded. Demographic, clinical and imaging variables were evaluated in a multivariate analysis for independent risk factors associated with PSE.
Medical records of 1586 stroke patients were reviewed, 691 met the inclusion criteria and had at least one year of follow-up. Of them, 428 (61.9%) were males. During follow-up, 6.2% had diagnosis of PSE (42/691) with a higher frequency of: previous ischemic stroke, higher NIHSS upon admission, treatment with rt-PA, higher Fazekas scale grade, cortical involvement, hemorrhagic transformation, acute symptomatic seizures, longer hospitalization and higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge compared to the group without PSE. In a multivariate analysis, acute symptomatic seizures (OR=3.22, p: 0.033), cortical involvement (OR=0.274, p < 0.05), Fazekas scale score (OR=0.519, p < 0.05) and mRS at discharge (OR=1.33, p: 0.043) were independent risk factors.
The variables related to higher risk of PSE were similar to those reported in the literature, highlighting the importance of neuroimaging findings, acute symptomatic seizures during hospitalization and neurological deficit at discharge. The data obtained will serve as the basis for construction of predictive models, allowing to individualize PSE probability in our population.

A Bayesian switching linear dynamical system for estimating seizure chronotypes.
Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by paroxysmal transitions between multistable states. Dynamical systems have been useful for modeling the paroxysmal nature of seizures. At the same time, intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have recently discovered that an electrographic measure of epileptogenicity, interictal epileptiform activity, exhibits cycling patterns ranging from ultradian to multidien rhythmicity, with seizures phase-locked to specific phases of these latent cycles. However, many mechanistic questions about seizure cycles remain unanswered. Here, we provide a principled approach to recast the modeling of seizure chronotypes within a statistical dynamical systems framework by developing a Bayesian switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) with variable selection to estimate latent seizure cycles. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that employs particle Gibbs with ancestral sampling to estimate latent cycles in epilepsy and apply unsupervised learning on spectral features of latent cycles to uncover clusters in cycling tendency. We analyze the largest database of patient-reported seizures in the world to comprehensively characterize multidien cycling patterns among 1,012 people with epilepsy, spanning from infancy to older adulthood. Our work advances knowledge of cycling in epilepsy by investigating how multidien seizure cycles vary in people with epilepsy, while demonstrating an application of an SLDS to frame seizure cycling within a nonlinear dynamical systems framework. It also lays the groundwork for future studies to pursue data-driven hypothesis generation regarding the mechanistic drivers of seizure cycles.

A tool for monitoring cell type-specific focused ultrasound neuromodulation and control of chronic epilepsy.
Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a powerful tool for noninvasive modulation of deep brain activity with promising therapeutic potential for refractory epilepsy; however, tools for examining FUS effects on specific cell types within the deep brain do not yet exist. Consequently, how cell types within heterogeneous networks can be modulated and whether parameters can be identified to bias these networks in the context of complex behaviors remains unknown. To address this, we developed a fiber Photometry Coupled focused Ultrasound System (PhoCUS) for simultaneously monitoring FUS effects on neural activity of subcortical genetically targeted cell types in freely behaving animals. We identified a parameter set that selectively increases activity of parvalbumin interneurons while suppressing excitatory neurons in the hippocampus. A net inhibitory effect localized to the hippocampus was further confirmed through whole brain metabolic imaging. Finally, these inhibitory selective parameters achieved significant spike suppression in the kainate model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy, opening the door for future noninvasive therapies.

Characteristics of people with epilepsy and Neurocysticercosis in three eastern African countries-A pooled analysis.
Neurocysticercosis (NCC), a zoonotic disease caused by the pork tapeworm T. solium, represents one of the most common causes of secondary epilepsy but remains often undiagnosed due to lack of awareness and diagnostic facilities.
We pooled data from four cross-sectional studies on epilepsy and NCC in eastern Africa. Study sites were in Uganda, Malawi and in Tanzania (Dar es Salaam and Haydom). The study in Uganda and Malawi were community-based, the two studies in Tanzania were hospital-based. The same questionnaire was used for assessment of clinical characteristics of patients with epilepsy. Computed tomography (CT) scans and serological testing were performed in order to diagnose NCC.
Overall, 1,179 people with epilepsy were included in our analysis. Of those, 941 PWE underwent CT scanning and were pooled for NCC analysis. Seventy patients were diagnosed with NCC, but NCC prevalence differed considerably between sites ranging from 2.0% (95%CI 0.4% to 3.6%) in Dar es Salaam to 17.5% (95%CI 12.4% to 22.6%) in Haydom. NCC prevalence did not show any association with sex but increased with age and was higher in rural than urban settings. In addition, being a farmer, non-Muslim, eating pork and living with pigs close by was associated with a higher NCC prevalence. PWE with NCC experienced their first epileptic seizure around 3 years later in life compared to PWE without NCC and their epileptic seizures seemed to be better controlled (p&lt;0.001). There was no difference between focal onset seizures and focal signs on neurological examination in both groups (p = 0.49 and p = 0.92, respectively). The rT24H-EITB had a sensitivity for the detection of NCC of 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51 to 84%), the LLGP of 76% (95%CI 58 to 89%) and the antigen ELISA of 36% (95% CI 20 to 55%).
NCC is prevalent among PWE in eastern Africa, although it may not be as common as previously stated. Demographic characteristics of PWE with NCC differed from those without NCC, but semiological characteristics and results on neurological examination did not differ compared to PWE without NCC. Interestingly, seizures seemed to be less frequent in PWE with NCC. Being aware of those differences and similarities may help triaging PWE for neuroimaging in order to establish a diagnosis of NCC.

Diverse Patterns and Clinical Significance of 11C-Methionine PET in Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumors.
Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) are slow-growing epilepsy-associated tumors. Low or normal 11C-methionine (MET) PET uptake helps to differentiate DNETs from other low-grade gliomas. However, diverse MET-PET uptake in DNETs has been observed. The aim of this study is to measure the clinical significance and prognostic value of MET-PET in DNET management.
Retrospective review of 26 DNET patients was done. Clinical characteristics, radiologic findings, and visual and quantitative MET-PET results were analyzed. PET uptake was calculated as the tumor-to-homotopic mirror ratio (TNRm) and tumor-to-contralateral cortex ratio (TNRc). The clinical activity of the tumors at the time of PET was classified into active and quiescent groups. The surgical outcome was defined as a composite of 2 different aspects: tumor progression and/or clinical events such as seizure recurrence or tumor bleeding.
Twenty-seven MET-PET examinations (20 initial MET-PET and 7 MET-PET during follow-up) were included. Clinically active tumors at the time of PET presented significantly higher values of TNRm and TNRc than quiescent tumors. High MET-PET uptake by visual grading, TNRm ≥ 1.90, and TNRc ≥ 1.85 exhibited poor prognosis for event-free survival.
MET-PET uptake correlates well with the clinical behavior of DNETs at the time of PET examination. Moreover, High MET-PET uptake is closely related to seizure recurrence if tumors are not entirely resected. Efforts to achieve gross total resection should be made for DNETs with high MET-PET uptake.

Gentiopicroside alleviated epileptogenesis in immature rats through inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting P2X7R expression.
This study aimed to elucidate the effects of Gentiopicroside (Gent) on epileptogenesis and underlying mechanisms.
The status epilepticus (SE) model was established by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lithium chloride (127mg/kg) and pilocarpine (50mg/kg) in immature rats. HAPI microglial cellular inflammation model was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1μg/mL) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 5mM). The differential concentrations of Gent were used to pretreat animal (200, 400, and 800mg/kg) and model cells (50, 100, and 200μM). Epileptic discharges were assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and Racine scale. Changes in spatial memory function were measured using the Morris water maze task test. Nissl and FJB staining were employed to assess the damage to hippocampus tissues. ELISA was used to detect the production of IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α. The expressions of P2X7R and NLRP3 were detected by q-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot, and cell viability was determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8).
Lithium chloride and pilocarpine (LICL-PILO) induced abnormal EEG activities, behavioral alterations, brain damage, and inflammatory responses in immature rats. However, Gent pretreatment significantly reduced the neuronal damage and spatial memory dysfunction induced by LICL-PILO. Additionally, Gent suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited the expression of P2X7R, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-1 in LPS/ATP-induced HAPI microglial cells.
Gent intervention could improve epileptogenesis in immature rats partially due to suppressing P2X7R and NLRP3 inflammasome.

Widening the Spectrum of Risk Factors, Comorbidities, and Prodromal Features of Parkinson Disease.
The prodromal phase of Parkinson disease (PD) may last for more than 10 years. Recognition of the spectrum and occurrence of risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal features of PD can increase understanding of the causes and development of the disease and help identify individuals at risk.
To identify the association of a subsequent diagnosis of PD with a range of risk factors and prodromal features, including lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and potential extracerebral manifestations of PD.
This was a case-control study using insurance claims of outpatient consultations of patients with German statutory health insurance between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2020. Included were patients with incident diagnosis of PD without a previous diagnosis of parkinsonism or dementia and controls matched 1:2 for age, sex, region, and earliest year of outpatient encounter.
Exposures were selected based on previous systematic reviews, case-control and cohort studies reporting on risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal features of PD.
Previously postulated risk factors and prodromal features of PD, using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding.
A total of 138 345 patients with incident PD (mean [SD] age, 75.1 [9.8] years; 73 720 male [53.3%]) and 276 690 matched controls (mean [SD] age, 75.1 (9.8) years; 147 440 male [53.3%]) were identified. Study participants were followed up for a mean (SD) of 6.0 (2.0) years. Consistent with previous reports, risk factors and prodromal features associated with PD included traumatic brain injury, odds ratio (OR), 1.62; 95% CI, 1.36-1.92; alcohol misuse, OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.44; hypertension, OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.26-1.31; anosmia, OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.59-2.93; and parasomnias (including RBD), OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84. In addition, there were associations with restless legs syndrome (OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 3.91-4.50), sleep apnea (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37-1.54), epilepsy (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 2.07-2.46), migraine (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.29), bipolar disorder (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 3.11-4.67), and schizophrenia (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 3.82-5.25). The following diagnoses were also found to be associated with PD: sensory impairments beyond anosmia, such as hearing loss (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20) and changes of skin sensation (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.43). There were also positive associations with skin disorders (eg, seborrheic dermatitis, OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15-1.46; psoriasis, OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21), gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25-1.33; gastritis, OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.33), conditions with a potential inflammatory component (eg, seronegative osteoarthritis, OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43), and diabetes types 1 (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.43) and 2 (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.27). Associations even 5 to 10 years before diagnosis included tremor (odds ratio [OR], 4.49; 95% CI, 3.98-5.06), restless legs syndrome (OR, 3.73; 95% CI, 3.39-4.09), bipolar disorder (OR, 3.80; 95% CI, 2.82-5.14), and schizophrenia (OR, 4.00; 95% CI, 3.31-4.85).
Results of this case-control study suggest that the associations found between PD and certain risk factors, comorbidities, and prodromal symptoms in a representative population may reflect possible early extrastriatal and extracerebral pathology of PD. This may be due to shared genetic risk with PD, medication exposure, or direct causation, or represent pathophysiologically relevant factors contributing to the pathogenesis of PD.

Potential of Capric Acid in Neurological Disorders: An Overview.
To solve the restrictions of a classical ketogenic diet, a modified medium-chain triglyceride diet was introduced which required only around 60% of dietary energy. Capric acid (CA), a small molecule, is one of the main components because its metabolic profile offers itself as an alternate source of energy to the brain in the form of ketone bodies. This is possible with the combined capability of CA to cross the blood-brain barrier and achieve a concentration of 50% concentration in the brain more than any other fatty acid in plasma. Natural sources of CA include vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil, mammalian milk and some seeds. Several studies have shown that CA has varied action on targets that include AMPA receptors, PPAR-γ, inflammatory/oxidative stress pathways and gut dysbiosis. Based on these lines of evidence, CA has proved to be effective in the amelioration of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, affective disorders and Alzheimer's disease. But these studies still warrant more pre-clinical and clinical studies that would further prove its efficacy. Hence, to understand the potential of CA in brain disease and associated comorbid conditions, an advance and rigorous molecular mechanistic study, apart from the reported in-vitro/in-vivo studies, is urgently required for the development of this compound through clinical setups.

Optimized SEEG-guided three-dimensional radiofrequency thermocoagulation for insular epilepsy.
The high risk of resection surgery for drug-resistant insular epilepsy has driven interest in new treatment techniques. Stereo-electroencephalography-guided three-dimensional radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SEEG-3D RFTC) offers an alternative option. Herein, we present the detailed protocol and investigation of the efficacy and safety of a preliminary observational study.
From February 2017 to April 2021, ten patients diagnosed with insular epilepsy were enrolled in the study. They underwent implantation of a combination of SEEG electrodes to form a high-density focal stereo-array in insula, including oblique electrodes through the long axis of insula and orthogonal electrodes to widely cover the medial and lateral insula. SEEG-3D RFTC was performed between two contiguous contacts of the same electrode, or between two adjacent contacts of different electrodes.
Surgical procedures were well tolerated, with no related long-term complications. Seizure-free outcome was achieved in seven patients (70%), including ILAE I in four and ILAE II in three. Two other (20%) patients had rare seizures (ILAE III). One (10%) patient experienced an ILAE IV outcome (follow-up = 12--63 months). The responder rate (including ILAE I-IV) was 100%.
The optimized SEEG-3D RFTC is an effective and safe option for the treatment of drug-resistant insular epilepsy.

Identification of genetic characteristics in pediatric epilepsy with focal cortical dysplasia type 2 using deep whole-exome sequencing.
Focal cortical dysplasia type 2 (FCD2) is a malformation of cortical development that constitutes a common cause of pediatric focal epilepsy. Germline or somatic variants in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway genes are the pathogenesis of FCD2.
In this study, whole-exome deep sequencing was performed on dysplastic cortex from focal epilepsy in children to explore genetic characteristics in FCD2.
Resected core lesions of FCD2 were confirmed by pathology, and peripheral blood was collected from 11 patients. Deep whole-exome sequencing (>500X) was performed on derived genomic DNA, germline, or somatic variants in brain-specific genes were analyzed and identified.
In 11 patients, a heterozygous likely pathogenic germline variant of DEPDC5 was identified in one case, while somatic variants were found in four brain samples. The frequencies of the somatic variant allele were 2.52%-5.12%. Somatic variants in AKT3, TSC2, and MTOR (mTOR signaling pathway genes) were found in three samples. Besides, one somatic variant was detected in MED12 which has not been reported to associate with FCD2.
Our study expanded the variant spectrum in the mTOR-GATOR pathway, and also detected a somatic variant in MED12 which was potentially associated with FCD 2.

The role of nutrition in canine idiopathic epilepsy management: Fact or fiction?
In the last decade, nutrition has gained interest in the management of canine idiopathic epilepsy (IE) based on growing scientific evidence. Diets can serve their functions through many pathways. One potential pathway includes the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which highlights the relationship between the brain and the intestines. Changing the brain's energy source and a number of dietary sourced anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors appears to be the basis for improved outcomes in IE. Selecting a diet with anti-seizure effects and avoiding risks of proconvulsant mediators as well as interference with anti-seizure drugs should all be considered in canine IE. This literature review provides information about preclinical and clinical evidence, including a systematic evaluation of the level of evidence, suggested mechanism of action and interaction with anti-seizure drugs as well as pros and cons of each potential dietary adaptation in canine IE.

Soticlestat, a novel cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitor, modifies acute seizure burden and chronic epilepsy-related behavioral deficits following Theiler's virus infection in mice.
Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common form of acquired epilepsy and can arise due to multiple inciting events, including central nervous system (CNS) infection. CNS infection with the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in male C57Bl/6J mice leads to acute, drug-resistant handling-induced seizures. Cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H) is a brain-specific enzyme that converts cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol; the primary mechanism of cholesterol catabolism in the brain. The novel CH24H inhibitor, soticlestat (SOT; or TAK-935), demonstrates the potential to restore excitatory/inhibitory balance in multiple preclinical models of hyperexcitability. This study thus sought to characterize the anticonvulsant potential of SOT in the TMEV model. Treatment with SOT (30 mg/kg, p.o.; n = 30) 0-7 days post-infection (DPI) reduced overall seizure burden and severity. SOT administration significantly delayed onset of infection-induced Racine stage 5 seizures, from 8.6 ± 0.6 (VEH-treated) to 10.8 ± 0.8 (SOT-treated) observation sessions. Infected mice were then allowed 36 days treatment-free recovery before assessing impact of earlier drug administration on epilepsy-related cognitive and behavioral comorbidities, including a non-habituated open field (OF) task. Total OF distance traveled was significantly less in SOT-treated mice compared to VEH-treated mice, suggesting attenuated TMEV-induced spatial memory deficits, or reduced chronic hyperexcitability. Mice with history of SOT treatment also spent significantly more time and traveled farther in the OF center, indicative of reduced epilepsy-induced anxiety-like behavior. These studies suggest that SOT is a mechanistically novel agent for symptomatic seizure control. Moreover, acute SOT administration during an epileptogenic insult may attenuate the resulting long-term behavioral comorbidities of epilepsy.

Is there an epilepsy belt of high prevalence rate in China?
Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological diseases. Our study is aimed to determine whether there is a focal region of high epilepsy prevalence in China.
All studies published between 1981 and 2020 investigating the prevalence of epilepsy in China were systematically reviewed. The geographical location, sample size, number of cases, urbanization rate, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, percentage of <15 years old, and medical insurance per capita were derived and analyzed. Criteria for a provincial region of high prevalence was defined as with higher epilepsy prevalence than the average prevalence of epilepsy in China.
A total of 60 studies provided data on the prevalence of epilepsy in 29 of 33 provincial regions of China. The average prevalence in China was 1.68 per 1,000, and 12 provincial regions met our criteria for a region of high epilepsy prevalence and constitute an epilepsy belt ranging along the division between the second step and the third step of China. The prevalence in the epilepsy belt was 331.9 per 100,000 population compared with 125.3 per 100,000 in regions outside the belt (
P
 < 0.05). Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in sample size, number of cases, urbanization rate, GDP per capita, percentage of <15 years old, or medical insurance per capita between the regions in and outside the epilepsy belt.
An epilepsy belt of high prevalence exists in 12 provincial regions locating along the division between the second step and the third step of China.

The correlation of temporal changes of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio with seizure severity and the following seizure tendency in patients with epilepsy.
Changes in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been reported to be associated with epilepsy. Here we aim to investigate the correlation of temporal changes of NLR level with seizure severity and the follow-up seizure attacks in patients with epilepsy (PWE).
We performed a retrospective analysis of the laboratory data including leukocyte count and NLR within 24 h of acute seizure and during the follow-up period of 5-14 days after acute seizure (NLR1, NLR2, respectively) in 115 PWE, and 98 healthy individuals were included as controls in this study. The correlation of laboratory data with seizure types, etiology of epilepsy, anti-seizure drugs (ASDs), seizure severity, and the follow-up seizure attacks in PWE was studied.
Leukocyte count (
P <
 0.001) and NLR level (
P
 < 0.001) were found significantly different between PWE and controls. On the other hand, a multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that NLR1 level (OR = 2.992, 
P
 = 0.001) and admission leukocyte (OR = 2.307, 
P
 = 0.002) were both independently associated with acute epileptic seizures. Especially, higher NLR1 level was significantly associated with status epileptics (
P
 = 0.013) and recurrent seizures after admission (
P <
 0.001). Furthermore, the multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that higher NLR1 was a predictor for the tendency of the following recurrent seizure attacks (OR = 1.144, 
P
 = 0.002). NLR2 was inversely correlated with ASDs taken (
P
 = 0.011). Levels of NLR1 (r = 0.441, 
P <
 0.001) and NLR2 (r = 0.241, 
P
 = 0.009) were both positively correlated with seizure severity.
Seizures were correlated with the alterations of systemic inflammation reflected by leukocyte and NLR. NLR1 and admission leukocyte were both independently associated with acute epileptic seizures. Higher NLR1 was associated with status epilepticus and independently predicted the tendency of the following epileptic seizures. NLR2 was significantly associated with ASDs taken. Besides, NLR may be used as a biomarker for seizure severity.

Impact of epilepsy and its treatment on brain metastasis from solid tumors: A retrospective study.
Retrospective observational study on medical records of patients with epilepsy related brain metastases (BM) to evaluate efficacy, safety and possible interaction with cancer treatment of different anti-seizure medications (ASMs) and the risk of seizures.
We consecutively reviewed all medical records of epilepsy-related BM patients from 2010 to 2020 who were followed for at least one month at the Brain Tumour-related Epilepsy Center of the IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute Rome, Italy.
We selected 111 cancer patients. Of these, only 42 had at least undergone a second neurological examination. In the whole population, 95 (85.2%) had seizures and 16 patients had no seizures (14.4%). The most frequently first ASM prescribed was LEV (40.5%). We observed a significant correlation between tumor site and probability of having seizures, but not between seizure type and age (>65 or <65 years). Among 42 patients, 26 were administered levetiracetam, followed by oxcarbazepine. Until the last follow-up, 19 never changed the first ASM, maintained the same dosage and remained seizure free. After a median of 7 months, 16 (38.1%) required changes in therapeutic treatment due to inefficacy. At the last follow-up, 24 patients (57.1%) were seizure free. Eighteen patients (42.8%) never achieved freedom from seizures despite had at least 2 therapy changes. Two patients changed ASM due to adverse events and 1 to phenobarbital owing to the interaction with cancer treatment. The mean daily dose of first ASM in all 42 patients was very close to the Defined Daily Dose (DDD).
In BM patients seizure incidence could be underestimated; a team evaluation performed by oncologist and neurologist together, could guarantee an accurate taking care of both oncological illness and epilepsy, in this fragile patient population. More than 50% of our patients respond to monotherapy with new generation ASMs. Furthermore we deemed in patients receiving chemotherapy the choice of ASM should consider possible interactions with antitumor therapies, for this reason newer generation ASMs should be the preferred choice. It is necessary to get close to the DDD before considering an ASM ineffective in seizure control.

Adult-onset Krabbe disease presenting with progressive myoclonic epilepsy and asymmetric occipital lesions: A case report.
Krabbe disease (KD), also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy, is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) gene. KD is more common in infants and young children than in adults. We reported the case of an adult-onset KD presenting with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) and cortical lesions mimicking mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. The whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a pathogenic homozygous missense mutation of the 
GALC
 gene. Parents of the patient were heterozygous for the mutation. The clinical, electrophysiological, and radiological data of the patient were retrospectively analyzed. The patient was a 24-year-old woman presenting with generalized seizures, progressive cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, gait ataxia, and action-induced myoclonus. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right occipital cortical ribbon sign without any other damage. This single case expands the clinical phenotypes of adult-onset KD.

What respiratory physicians should know about parasomnias.
Parasomnias have significant quality-of-life, prognostic and potentially forensic implications for patients and their bed-partners. Identifying key clinical features will accelerate diagnosis and appropriate management for these patients. Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that arise out of, or during, sleep. They can include movements, behaviours, emotions, perceptions, dreams or autonomic nervous system activity. While more common during childhood, they can persist into, or present 
de novo
, during adulthood. Parasomnias can arise out of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as in confusional arousals, sleepwalking, sleep terrors or sleep-related eating disorder, or out of REM sleep, as in REM behaviour disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis or nightmare disorder. Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy is an important differential diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with a parasomnia. A thorough clinical history, including a collateral history if available, is crucial to identify characteristic clinical features. Video polysomnography is useful to identify macro- and micro-sleep architectural features, characteristic behavioural events, and any concomitant sleep pathologies. Treatment of parasomnias involves a combined approach of pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention, including safety measures, sleep hygiene and medicines such as clonazepam or melatonin to improve sleep consolidation and reduce behavioural activity. As parasomnias can not only be disruptive for the patient and their bed-partner but have important prognostic or forensic consequences, an understanding of their pathophysiology, clinical features and management is valuable for any respiratory physician who may encounter them.

Global trends in research of glutamate in epilepsy during past two decades: A bibliometric analysis.
Epilepsy affects more than 70 million people in the world. It is characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures, and it is related to many neurological, cognitive, and psychosocial consequences. Glutamate neurotransmitter dysfunction has essential functions in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. In this work, bibliometric analysis was conducted to explore the trends, frontiers, and hotspots of the global scientific output of glutamate in epilepsy research in the past 20 years. The Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was searched to obtain information on publications and records published between 2002 and 2021. VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to conduct bibliometric and visual analyses on the overall distribution of annual output, major countries, active institutions, journals, authors, commonly cited literature, and keywords. The impact and quality of the papers were assessed using the global citation score (GCS). Four thousand eight hundred ninety-one publications were retrieved in total. During the past two decades, the number of publications (Np) associated with glutamate in epilepsy has risen yearly. The United States has published the most papers; its H-index and number of citations are also the highest. The League of European Research Universities (LERU) was the most productive institution. In 2016, the total score of the paper written by Zhang Y was 854, ranking first. The keywords that appear most frequently are "epilepsy," "glutamate," "temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)," "hippocampus," and "seizures." This study showed that although the publications related to epileptic glutamate fluctuated slightly, the Np increased overall. The United States is a great creator and influential country in this field. The first three authors are Eid, T., Aronica, E., and Smolders, I. "spectrum," "animal model," "inflammation," "mutation," "dysfunction," and "prefrontal cortex" are increasing research hotspots. By recognizing the most critical indicators (researchers, countries, research institutes, and journals of glutamate release in epilepsy research), the research hotspot of glutamate in epilepsy could help countries, scholars, and policymakers in this field enhance their understanding of the role of glutamate in epilepsy and make decisions.

Exploring correlation between social determinants and overweight/obesity in children and youths with epilepsy.
This study aimed to explore the correlation between social determinants and overweight and obesity in children and youths with epilepsy.
The study data were derived from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) 2016-2017 and 2018-2019, a cross-sectional sample of young people aged 10-17. Three groups participated by weight: 423 in body mass index (BMI) 5th-84th group (normal weight), 108 in BMI 85th-94th group (overweight), and 124 in BMI ≥ 95th group (obesity). Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted. The three subgroups were divided to explore the correlation between social determinants and overweight and obesity.
A total of 655 children were included. After adjusting for sex, age, race, use of cigarets, cigars, or pipe tobacco inside, afterschool activity, and physical activity, children in poor physical condition reported by their parents [OR = 1.573 (95% CI, 1.164-2.125)] were associated with overweight/obesity. There were negative correlations between parents with higher education and overweight/obesity, especially in children and youths with previous or current epilepsy groups. Also, overweight/obesity was correlated with the 200%-400% family poverty level (FPL) [the adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.156 (95% CI, 0.028-0.876)] and above 400% FPL [the adjusted OR = 0.121 (95% CI, 0.023-0.641)] in children and youths with mild symptoms of epilepsy, and above 400% FPL [the adjusted OR = 0.103 (95% CI, 0.023-0.460)] in children with moderate to severe epilepsy.
Poor physical conditions were correlated with obesity in childhood epilepsy. Parents with higher education and FPLs were negatively correlated to childhood obesity. Therefore, this study was intended to advocate for a greater emphasis on BMI for children and youths with epilepsy in families with lower-educated and low-income groups.

A novel mutation in ryanodine receptor 2 (
Ryanodine receptor 2 (
RYR2
) encodes a component of a calcium channel. 
RYR2
 variants were well-reported to be associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), but rarely reported in epilepsy cases. Here, we present a novel heterozygous mutation of 
RYR2
 in a child with focal epilepsy.
At the age of 2 years and 7 months, the patient experienced seizures, such as eye closure, tooth clenching, clonic jerking and hemifacial spasm, as well as abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). Then, he was analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The mutations of both the proband and his parents were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of the variant was further assessed by population-based variant frequency screening, evolutionary conservation comparison, and American Association for Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) scoring.
WES sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous truncating mutation [c.12670G > T, 
p
.(Glu4224*), NM_001035.3] in 
RYR2
 gene of the proband. Sanger sequencing confirmed that this mutation was inherited from his mother. This novel variant was predicted to be damaging by different bioinformatics methods. Cardiac investigation showed that the proband had no structural abnormalities, but sinus tachycardia.
We proposed that RYR2 is a potential candidate gene for focal epilepsy, and epilepsy patients carried with RYR2 variants should be given more attention, even if they do not show cardiac abnormalities.

Human stefin B: from its structure, folding, and aggregation to its function in health and disease.
Mutations in the gene for human stefin B (cystatin B) cause progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (EPM1), a neurodegenerative disorder. The most common change is dodecamer repeats in the promoter region of the gene, though missense and frameshift mutations also appear. Human stefin B primarily acts as a cysteine cathepsin inhibitor, and it also exhibits alternative functions. It plays a protective role against oxidative stress, likely 
via
 reducing mitochondrial damage and thus generating fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accordingly, lack of stefin B results in increased inflammation and 
NLRP3
 inflammasome activation, producing more ROS. The protein is cytosolic but also has an important role in the nucleus, where it prevents cleavage of the N terminal part of histone 3 by inhibiting cathepsins L and B and thus regulates transcription and cell cycle. Furthermore, it has been shown that stefin B is oligomeric in cells and that it has a specific role in the physiology of the synapse and in vesicular transport. On the basis of my research team's data on the structure, folding, and aggregation of stefin B, we have proposed that it might regulate proteostasis, possessing a chaperone-like function. In this review, I synthesize these observations and derive some conclusions on possible sources of EPM1 pathology. The interaction partners of stefin B and other gene mutations leading to EPM1-like pathology are discussed and common pathways are pinpointed.

Commonalities for comorbidity: Overlapping features of the endocannabinoid system in depression and epilepsy.
A wealth of clinical and pre-clinical data supports a bidirectional comorbidity between depression and epilepsy. This suggests commonalities in underlying mechanisms that may serve as targets for more effective treatment strategies. Unfortunately, many patients with this comorbidity are highly refractory to current treatment strategies, while others experience a worsening of one arm of the comorbidity when treating the other arm. This highlights the need for novel pharmaceutical targets that may provide safe and effective relief for both depression and epilepsy symptoms. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) of the brain has become an area of intense interest for possible roles in depression and epilepsy. Several existing literature reviews have provided in-depth analysis of the involvement of various aspects of the ECS in depression or epilepsy separately, while others have addressed the effectiveness of different treatment strategies targeting the ECS in either condition individually. However, there is not currently a review that considers the ECS when both conditions are comorbid. This mini-review will address areas of common overlap between the ECS in depression and in epilepsy, such as commonalities in endocannabinoids themselves, their receptors, and degradative enzymes. These areas of overlap will be discussed alongside their implications for treatment of this challenging comorbidity.

Brain tissue oxygen dynamics while mimicking the functional deficiency of interneurons.
The dynamic interaction between excitatory and inhibitory activity in the brain is known as excitatory-inhibitory balance (EIB). A significant shift in EIB toward excitation has been observed in numerous pathological states and diseases, such as autism or epilepsy, where interneurons may be dysfunctional. The consequences of this on neurovascular interactions remains to be elucidated. Specifically, it is not known if there is an elevated metabolic consumption of oxygen due to increased excitatory activity. To investigate this, we administered microinjections of picrotoxin, a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist, to the rabbit cortex in the awake state to mimic the functional deficiency of GABAergic interneurons. This caused an observable shift in EIB toward excitation without the induction of seizures. We used chronically implanted electrodes to measure both neuronal activity and brain tissue oxygen concentrations (PO
2
) simultaneously and in the same location. Using a high-frequency recording rate for PO
2
, we were able to detect two important phenomena, (1) the shift in EIB led to a change in the power spectra of PO
2
 fluctuations, such that higher frequencies (8-15 cycles per minute) were suppressed and (2) there were brief periods (dips with a duration of less than 100 ms associated with neuronal bursts) when PO
2
 dropped below 10 mmHg, which we defined as the threshold for hypoxia. The dips were followed by an overshoot, which indicates either a rapid vascular response or decrease in oxygen consumption. Our results point to the essential role of interneurons in brain tissue oxygen regulation in the resting state.

Neuroprotective and anti-epileptic potentials of genus Artemisia L.
The Genus Artemisia L. is one of the largest genera in the Asteraceae family growing wild over in Europe, North America, and Central Asia and has been widely used in folk medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Phytochemical and psychopharmacological studies indicated that the genus Artemisia extracts contain various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds and possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antimalarial, and antitumor activity. Recently, increasing experimental studies demonstrated that many Artemisia extracts offer a great antiepileptic potential, which was attributed to their bioactive components 
via
 various mechanisms of action. However, detailed literature on the antiepileptic properties of the genus Artemisia and its mechanism of action is segregated. In this review, we tried to gather the detailed neuroprotective and antiepileptic properties of the genus Artemisia and its possible underlying mechanisms. In this respect, 63 articles were identified in the PubMed and Google scholars databases, from which 18 studies were examined based on the pharmacological use of the genus Artemisia species in epilepsy. The genus Artemisia extracts have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neurotransmitter-modulating, anti-apoptotic, anticonvulsant, and pro-cognitive properties by modulating oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial ROS production and an imbalance of antioxidant enzymes, by protecting mitochondrial membrane potential required for ATP production, by upregulating GABA-A receptor and nACh receptor activities, and by interfering with various anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, such as mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, ERK/CREB/Bcl-2 pathway and Nrf2 pathway. This review provides detailed information about some species of the genus Artemisia as potential antiepileptic agents. Hence, we recommend further investigations on the purification and identification of the most biological effective compounds of Artemisia and the mechanisms of their action to cure epilepsy and other neurological diseases.

The therapeutic potential of triptolide and celastrol in neurological diseases.
Neurological diseases are complex diseases affecting the brain and spinal cord, with numerous etiologies and pathogenesis not yet fully elucidated. 
Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F.
 (TWHF) is a traditional Chinese medicine with a long history of medicinal use in China and is widely used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. With the rapid development of modern technology, the two main bioactive components of TWHF, triptolide and celastrol, have been found to have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-tumor effects and can be used in the treatment of a variety of diseases, including neurological diseases. In this paper, we summarize the preclinical studies of triptolide and celastrol in neurological diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, brain and spinal cord injury, and epilepsy. In addition, we review the mechanisms of action of triptolide and celastrol in neurological diseases, their toxicity, related derivatives, and nanotechnology-based carrier system.

Tremor and Movement Slowness Are Two Unrelated Adverse Effects Induced by Valproate Intake.
To date, only a few clinical and neurophysiological studies have assessed the features of valproate-induced tremor (VIT), and whether valproate (VPA) affects voluntary movements is underinvestigated.
To better characterize the clinical and neurophysiological features of VIT in patients with epilepsy and the effect of VPA on the execution of voluntary movement.
We tested 29 patients with VIT (13 taking VPA alone and 16 taking VPA plus other antiepileptics). Patients underwent a neurological examination, video recordings and kinematic assessments of postural, kinetic, and resting upper limb tremor using a motion analysis system. Movement execution was tested by kinematic assessment of finger tapping. Data of patients with VIT were compared with those of 13 patients with epilepsy taking VPA but without tremor, 13 patients with epilepsy who were not on VPA treatment, 20 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 20 healthy controls (HCs).
Clinical and kinematic evaluations showed that tremor in patients taking VPA alone was less severe than tremor in patients taking VPA plus other antiepileptics. All patients taking VPA, regardless of the presence of tremor, performed slower finger tapping compared with HCs, similar to what was observed in PD, although with no sequence effect. Patients with epilepsy without VPA showed a normal motor performance.
Tremor and movement slowness are motor signs induced by VPA. VIT severity is exacerbated when VPA is taken in combination with other antiepileptics. VPA-induced slowness occurs regardless of tremor, may precede tremor development, and is not attributed to epilepsy.

Localizing targets for neuromodulation in drug-resistant epilepsy using intracranial EEG and computational model.
Neuromodulation has emerged as a promising technique for the treatment of epilepsy. The target for neuromodulation is critical for the effectiveness of seizure control. About 30% of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) fail to achieve seizure freedom after surgical intervention. It is difficult to find effective brain targets for neuromodulation in these patients because brain regions are damaged during surgery. In this study, we propose a novel approach for localizing neuromodulatory targets, which uses intracranial EEG and multi-unit computational models to simulate the dynamic behavior of epileptic networks through external stimulation. First, we validate our method on a multivariate autoregressive model and compare nine different methods of constructing brain networks. Our results show that the directed transfer function with surrogate analysis achieves the best performance. Intracranial EEGs of 11 DRE patients are further analyzed. These patients all underwent surgery. In three seizure-free patients, the localized targets are concordant with the resected regions. For the eight patients without seizure-free outcome, the localized targets in three of them are outside the resected regions. Finally, we provide candidate targets for neuromodulation in these patients without seizure-free outcome based on virtual resected epileptic network. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to locate optimal targets for neuromodulation. We hope that our approach can provide a new tool for localizing patient-specific targets for neuromodulation therapy in DRE.

Poststroke Seizure and Epilepsy: A Review of Incidence, Risk Factors, Diagnosis, Pathophysiology, and Pharmacological Therapies.
Stroke is the most common cause of epilepsy and ultimately leads to a decrease in the quality of life of those affected. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes can both lead to poststroke epilepsy (PSE). Significant risk factors for PSE include age < 65age less than 65 years, stroke severity measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), cortical involvement, and genetic factors such as TRPM6 polymorphism. The diagnosis of PSE is made by using imaging modalities, blood biomarkers, and prognostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) is currently the gold standard to diagnose PSE, while new combinations of modalities are being tested to increase diagnostic specificity. This literature review uncovers a newly found mechanism for the pathology of poststroke epilepsy. The pathogenesis of early-onset and late-onset is characterized by sequelae of neuronal cellular hypoxia and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, respectively. Interleukin-6 is responsible for increasing the activity of glial cells, causing gliosis and hyperexcitability of neurons. Epinephrine, high-mobility group protein B1, downregulation of CD32, and upregulation of HLA-DR impact the pathology of poststroke epilepsy by inhibiting the normal neuronal immune response. Decreased levels of neuropeptide Y, a neurotransmitter, act through multiple unique mechanisms, such as inhibiting intracellular Ca
2+
 accumulation and acting as an anti-inflammatory, also implemented in the worsening progression of poststroke epilepsy. Additionally, CA1 hippocampal resonant neurons that increase theta oscillation are associated with poststroke epilepsy. Hypertensive small vessel disease may also have an implication in the temporal lobe epilepsy by causing occult microinfarctions. Furthermore, this review highlights the potential use of statins as primary prophylaxis against PSE, with multiple studies demonstrating a reduction in incidence using statins alone, statins in combination with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and statins with aspirin. The evidence strongly suggests that the second generation AEDs are a superior treatment method for PSE. Data from numerous studies demonstrate their relative lack of significant drug interactions, increased tolerability, and potential superiority in maintaining seizure-free status.

Child with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency caused by a novel complex heterozygous mutation in the 
Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency is a rare autosomal-recessive defect of purine metabolism caused by mutation of the 
ADSL
 gene. It can cause severe neurological impairment and diverse clinical manifestations, including epilepsy.
Here, we describe a 3-year-old Chinese boy who had both psychomotor retardation and refractory epilepsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed myelin hypoplasia. Electroencephalography findings supported a diagnosis of epilepsy. Whole-exon sequencing revealed the presence of a novel complex heterozygous mutation in the 
ADSL
 gene: The splicing mutation c.154-3C>G and the missense mutation c.71C>T (p. Pro24Leu). Considering the patient's clinical presentation and genetic test results, the complex heterozygous mutation was predicted to prevent both 
ADSL
 alleles from producing normal ADSL, which may have led to ADSL deficiency. Finally, the child was diagnosed with ADSL deficiency.
We identified a novel complex heterozygous mutation in the 
ADSL
 gene associated with ADSL deficiency, thus expanding the known spectrum of pathogenic mutations that cause ADSL deficiency. Additionally, we describe epilepsy that occurs in patients with ADSL deficiency.

Spontaneous bilateral femur neck fracture secondary to grand mal seizure: A case report.
Spontaneous bilateral femur neck fracture is a rare entity in the general population.
A 17-year-old immobile, developmentally delayed male with the sequelae of cerebral palsy fractured both femoral necks during a grand mal epileptic seizure. He had been treated with valproic acid as an antiseizure medication for about 10 years; otherwise, he had no history of drug use. The laboratory analysis was normal except a marked vitamin D deficiency. Closed reduction and osteosynthesis with percutaneous cannulated screws were performed. Solid union was observed at 6 mo, and rapid postoperative rehabilitation was started.
A femoral neck fracture may occur in a person with epilepsy presenting with hip pain in the emergency department.

Novel subscalp and intracranial devices to wirelessly record and analyze continuous EEG in unsedated, behaving dogs in their natural environments: A new paradigm in canine epilepsy research.
Epilepsy is characterized by unprovoked, recurrent seizures and is a common neurologic disorder in dogs and humans. Roughly 1/3 of canines and humans with epilepsy prove to be drug-resistant and continue to have sporadic seizures despite taking daily anti-seizure medications. The optimization of pharmacologic therapy is often limited by inaccurate seizure diaries and medication side effects. Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been a cornerstone of diagnosis and classification in human epilepsy, but because of several technical challenges has played a smaller clinical role in canine epilepsy. The interictal (between seizures) and ictal (seizure) EEG recorded from the epileptic mammalian brain shows characteristic electrophysiologic biomarkers that are very useful for clinical management. A fundamental engineering gap for both humans and canines with epilepsy has been the challenge of obtaining continuous long-term EEG in the patients' natural environment. We are now on the cusp of a revolution where continuous long-term EEG from behaving canines and humans will be available to guide clinicians in the diagnosis and optimal treatment of their patients. Here we review some of the devices that have recently emerged for obtaining long-term EEG in ambulatory subjects living in their natural environments.

Brain Molecular Mechanisms in Rasmussen Encephalitis.
Identify molecular mechanisms in brain tissue of Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) when compared to people with non-RE epilepsy (PWE) and control cases using whole exome sequencing (WES), RNAseq, and proteomics.
Frozen brain tissue (ages 2-19 years) was obtained from control autopsy (n=14), surgical PWE (n=10), and surgical RE cases (n=27). We evaluated WES variants in RE associated with epilepsy, seizures, RE, and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Differential expression was evaluated by RNAseq (adjusted p<0.05) and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (false discovery rate<5%) in the three groups.
WES revealed no common pathogenic variants in RE, although several rare and likely deleterious variants of unknown significance (VUS; ANGPTL7/MTOR, SCN1A, FCGR3B, MTOR) and more common HLA VUS in >25% RE cases (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA2) all with allele frequency <5% in the general population. RNAseq in RE vs. PWE (1516 altered transcripts) revealed significant activation of crosstalk between dendritic and natural killer cells (p=7.94x10
-6
 , z=2.65), in RE vs. control (7466 transcripts) neuroinflammation signaling activation (p=6.31x10
-13
 , z=5.07), and in PWE vs. control (945 transcripts) phagosome formation activation (p=2.00x10
-13
 , z=5.61). Proteomics detected fewer altered targets.
In RE, we identified activated immune signaling pathways and immune cell type annotation enrichment that suggest roles of the innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as HLA variants that may increase vulnerability to RE. Follow up studies could evaluate cell type density and subregional localization associated with top targets, clinical history (neuropathology, disease duration), and whether modulating crosstalk between dendritic and natural killer cells may limit disease progression.

Ultrasound Elastography in Neurosurgery: Current Applications and Future Perspectives.
Similar to clinical palpation, Ultrasound Elastography (USE) helps distinguish between tissues by providing information on their elasticity. While it has been widely explored and has been applied to many body organs, USE has not been studied as extensively for application in neurosurgery. The current systematic review was performed to identify articles related to the use of interoperative USE in neurosurgery.
Search included MEDLINE(R) database. Only original peer-reviewed full-text articles were included. No language or publication year restrictions were imposed. Two independent reviewers assessed the search results for relevance. The identified articles were screened by title, abstract, and full-text review.
Seventeen articles were included in the qualitative analysis; 13 articles were related to oncology, epilepsy (n=3), and spine (n=1). In oncology, USE was found useful in defining tumor stiffness, aiding surgical planning, detecting residual tumors, discriminating between tumor and brain tissue, and differentiating between different tumors. In epilepsy, USE could improve the detection of epileptogenic foci, thereby enhancing the prospect of complete and safe resection. The application in spinal surgery was limited to demonstrating that a compressed spinal cord is stiffer than the decompressed one.
USE was found to be a safe, quick, portable, and economic tool that was a useful intraoperative adjunct to provide information corresponding to a variety of neurosurgical diseases, at different stages of surgery. This review describes the current intraoperative neurosurgical applications of USE; the concept of elasticity; different USE modalities as well as the technical challenges, limitations, and possible future implications.

Spectrum of Common Pediatric Neurological Disorders: A Cross-Sectional Study From Three Tertiary Care Centres Across Pakistan.
There is dearth of information on the spectrum of neurological disorders among children less than 18 years of age. The aim of this study is to identify the commonly presenting neurological disorders among children aged ≤ 18 years in Pakistan.
We conducted a cross-sectional study at three tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan.
A total of 17,176 children were included in our study; 61.8% were boys and 38.2% females. The most commonly presenting neurological disorder was epilepsy (36%), followed by behavior disorders (16%) and cerebral palsy (10.5%). There was significant difference between children less than 5 years and greater than 5 years age groups, with less than 5 years age group showing higher prevalence for behavioral disorders (P < 0.001), cerebral palsy (P < 0.001), infections (P = 0.014), sequalae (P < 0.001), and developmental disorders (P < 0.001). Gender-wise distribution showed epilepsy to be the most common neurological disorder among both genders, with a significant difference being reported between gender and epilepsy (P = 0.009), headache disorders (P < 0.001), neuroinflammatory disorders (P = 0.025), neurocutaneous syndromes (P < 0.001), behavioral diseases (P < 0.001), cerebral palsy (P = 0.009), and movement disorders (P < 0.001).
The result of this analysis helps to assess the commonly presenting neurological disorders in children. This study will help health care workers in resource-poor settings within Pakistan to be mindful of the common neurological disorders while diagnosing a child with neurological symptoms in an outpatient setting. Health care providers need to be trained to identify and treat these common conditions; however, there is still a dire need for more trained neurologists across the country.

Heteroplasmic Mutant Load Differences in Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome is influenced by mutant pathogenicity and corresponding heteroplasmic loads; however, the manner in which heteroplasmic mutant load affects patient phenotypes and the relationship between mutant types and heteroplasmic mutant loads remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the distribution of the mutant load of different mtDNA mutations in a single-center cohort.
We used next-generation sequencing to confirm mtDNA mutations in 31 patients with Leigh syndrome. Subsequently, we counted the number of mtDNA reads to quantitatively analyze the heteroplasmic mutant load and categorize the patients according to the mtDNA mutations they harbored. Confirmed cases of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome were classified according to the mutations observed in six genes and 10 nucleotides.
Of the 31 patients with Leigh syndrome, 27 harbored known pathogenic mutations. We discovered that MT-ATP6 was the most commonly mutated gene (n = 13 patients), followed by MT-ND3 (n = 7) and MT-ND5 (n = 4). MT-ATP6 had a significantly higher mutant load than MT-ND3 and MT-ND5 (P < 0.001, each). By contrast, MT-ND5 had a significantly lower mutant load than MT-ND3 (P = 0.007). Notably, the mutation loads varied significantly among patients carrying the MT-ATP6, MT-ND3, and MT-ND5 mutations.
Our study illustrated the heteroplasmic diversity and phenotypic expression threshold of mutated mitochondrial genes in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome. The results provide promising insights into the genotype-phenotype correlation in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome that are expected to guide the development of tailored treatments for Leigh syndrome.

Neural modulations in the auditory cortex during internal and external attention tasks: A single-patient intracranial recording study.
Brain sensory processing is not passive, but is rather modulated by our internal state. Different research methods such as non-invasive imaging methods and intracranial recording of the local field potential (LFP) have been used to study to what extent sensory processing and the auditory cortex in particular are modulated by selective attention. However, at the level of the single- or multi-units the selective attention in humans has not been tested. In addition, most previous research on selective attention has explored externally-oriented attention, but attention can be also directed inward (i.e., internal attention), like spontaneous self-generated thoughts and mind-wandering. In the present study we had a rare opportunity to record multi-unit activity (MUA) in the auditory cortex of a patient. To complement, we also analyzed the LFP signal of the macro-contact in the auditory cortex. Our experiment consisted of two conditions with periodic beeping sounds. The participants were asked either to count the beeps (i.e., an "external attention" condition) or to recall the events of the previous day (i.e., an "internal attention" condition). We found that the four out of seven recorded units in the auditory cortex showed increased firing rates in "external attention" compared to "internal attention" condition. The beginning of this attentional modulation varied across multi-units between 30-50 msec and 130-150 msec from stimulus onset, a result that is compatible with an early selection view. The LFP evoked potential and induced high gamma activity both showed attentional modulation starting at about 70-80 msec. As the control, for the same experiment we recorded MUA activity in the amygdala and hippocampus of two additional patients. No major attentional modulation was found in the control regions. Overall, we believe that our results provide new empirical information and support for existing theoretical views on selective attention and spontaneous self-generated cognition.

High-resolution cortical parcellation based on conserved brain landmarks for localization of multimodal data to the nearest centimeter.
Precise cortical brain localization presents an important challenge in the literature. Brain atlases provide data-guided parcellation based on functional and structural brain metrics, and each atlas has its own unique benefits for localization. We offer a parcellation guided by intracranial electroencephalography, a technique which has historically provided pioneering advances in our understanding of brain structure-function relationships. We used a consensus boundary mapping approach combining anatomical designations in Duvernoy's Atlas of the Human Brain, a widely recognized textbook of human brain anatomy, with the anatomy of the MNI152 template and the magnetic resonance imaging scans of an epilepsy surgery cohort. The Yale Brain Atlas consists of 690 one-square centimeter parcels based around conserved anatomical features and each with a unique identifier to communicate anatomically unambiguous localization. We report on the methodology we used to create the Atlas along with the findings of a neuroimaging study assessing the accuracy and clinical usefulness of cortical localization using the Atlas. We also share our vision for the Atlas as a tool in the clinical and research neurosciences, where it may facilitate precise localization of data on the cortex, accurate description of anatomical locations, and modern data science approaches using standardized brain regions.

A pediatric case of autoimmune encephalitis with chronologically moving seizure foci and cortical lesions: A case report.
Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is a relatively newly described category of immune-mediated diseases involving the central nervous system with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from relatively mild or insidious onset of cognitive impairment to more complex forms of encephalopathy with medically refractory seizures. Single or multifocal seizures accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive or memory impairments are suggestive of clinical features at AIE onset.
A six-year-old boy presented with repetitive focal seizures, slowly progressive emotional liability, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms. Seizure types varied during the clinical course, sometimes emerging as clusters or statuses. MRI performed during seizure clustering/status revealed moving signal abnormalities. We successfully treated the patient with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed pleocytosis and marked elevation of antibodies against N-terminals of N-methyl-d-aspartate type glutamate receptor subunits and granzyme B.
We report a case of moving seizure foci with abnormal MRI findings. Although the onset of psychiatric symptoms slowly progressed to those atypical for AIE, responsiveness to immunotherapy, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and autoantibodies all indicated AIE. We thus suggest that moving seizure foci and abnormal MRI signals may be findings of AIE.

Hydranencephaly in CENPJ-related Seckel syndrome.
Pathogenic variants in CENPJ have been first identified in consanguineous Pakistani families with Hereditary Primary Microcephaly type 6 (MCPH6). In addition to primary microcephaly, the CENPJ-related phenotypic spectrum lately included also distinctive and peculiar 'bird-like' craniofacial dysmorphisms, intrauterine and/or postnatal growth retardation, and moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID). These features are also part of the clinical spectrum of Seckel syndrome (SCKL) a genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition caused by mutations in different genes involved in cell cycle progression. Among these, CENPJ is responsible for type 4 Seckel syndrome (SCKL4). The literature reports two individuals affected by SCKL4 suffering from seizures and other two individuals with other brain malformations in addition to microcephaly. However, neither epilepsy nor brain malformations are described in detail and genotype-phenotype information remains limited. We describe the first Caucasian affected with SCKL4 and harboring a novel, homozygous mutation in CENPJ. We detail the clinical and neuroradiological findings including structural focal epilepsy and a severe brain malformation (i.e., hydranencephaly) that was never associated with SCKL4 to date.

Cannabidiol attenuates fear memory expression in female rats via hippocampal 5-HT
Growing evidence from male rodent and human studies suggests that cannabidiol (CBD) modulates the expression of aversive memories and anxiety-related responses. The limited data on whether and how CBD influences these aspects in females could have therapeutic implications given the increased susceptibility of women to anxiety- and stress-related disorders relative to men. Female studies are also essential to examine inherent aspects that potentially contribute to differences in responsiveness to CBD. Here we addressed these questions in adult female rats. Contextually fear-conditioned animals acutely treated with CBD (1.0-10 mg/kg) were tested 45 min later. In subsequent experiments, we investigated the estrous cycle effects and the contribution of dorsal hippocampus (DH) serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) and cannabinoid types 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2) receptors to CBD-induced effects on memory retrieval/expression. The effects of pre-retrieval systemic or intra-DH CBD administration on subsequent fear extinction were also assessed. Lastly, we evaluated the open arms avoidance and stretched-attend postures in females exposed to the elevated plus-maze after systemic CBD treatment. CBD 3.0 and 10 mg/kg administered before conditioned context exposure reduced females' freezing. This action remained unchanged across the estrous cycle and involved DH 5-HT1A receptors activation. CBD impaired memory reconsolidation after retrieval resulting in lower fear during early extinction. CBD applied directly to the DH was sufficient to reproduce the effects of systemic CBD treatment. CBD 3.0 and 10 mg/kg reduced anxiety-related responses scored in the elevated plus-maze. Our findings demonstrate that CBD attenuates the behavioral manifestation of learned fear and anxiety in female rats.

The anterior nucleus of the thalamus plays a role in the epileptic network.
We investigated both the metabolic differences and interictal/ictal discharges of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) in patients with epilepsy to clarify the relationship between the ANT and the epileptic network.
Nineteen patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography were studied. Metabolic differences in ANT were analyzed using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography with three-dimensional (3D) visual and quantitative analyses. Interictal and ictal discharges in the ANT were analyzed using visual and time-frequency analyses. The relationship between interictal discharge and metabolic differences was analyzed.
We found that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) showed significant metabolic differences in bilateral ANT compared with extratemporal lobe epilepsy in 3D visual and quantitative analyses. Four types of interictal activities were recorded from the ANT: spike, high-frequency oscillation (HFO), slow-wave, and α-rhythmic activity. Spike and HFO waveforms were recorded mainly in patients with TLE. Two spike patterns were recorded: synchronous and independent. In 83.3% of patients, ANT was involved during seizures. Three seizure onset types of ANT were recorded: low-voltage fast activity, rhythmic spikes, and theta band discharge. The time interval of seizure onset between the seizure onset zone and ANT showed two patterns: immediate and delayed.
ANT can receive either interictal discharges or ictal discharges which propagate from the epileptogenic zones. Independent epileptic discharges can also be recorded from the ANT in some patients. Metabolic anomalies and epileptic discharges in the ANT indicate that the ANT plays a role in the epileptic network in most patients with epilepsy, especially TLE.

High-dose oral glutamine supplementation reduces elevated glutamate levels in CSF in patients with MELAS syndrome.
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations. There are no disease-modifying therapies, and treatment remains mainly supportive. We previously showed that patients with MELAS syndrome had significantly increased CSF glutamate and significantly decreased CSF glutamine levels compared to controls. Glutamine has many metabolic fates in neurons and astrocytes, and the glutamate-glutamine cycle couples with many metabolic pathways depending on cellular requirements. We aimed to compare CSF glutamate and glutamine levels before and after dietary glutamine supplementation. We postulated that high-dose oral glutamine supplementation could reduce the increase in glutamate levels.
This open-label, single-cohort study determined the safety and changes in glutamate and glutamine levels in CSF after twelve weeks of oral glutamine supplementation.
Nine adult patients with MELAS syndrome (66.7% females, mean age 35.8 ± 3.2 years) were included. After glutamine supplementation, CSF glutamate levels were significantly reduced (9.77 ± 1.21 vs. 18.48 ± 1.34 μmol/L, p <0.001), and CSF glutamine levels were significantly increased (433.66 ± 15.31 vs. 336.31 ± 12.92 μmol/L, p=0.002). A side effect observed in four of nine patients was a mild sensation of satiety. One patient developed mild and transient elevation of transaminases, and another patient was admitted for an epileptic status without stroke-like episode.
This study demonstrates that high-dose oral glutamine supplementation significantly reduces CSF glutamate and increases CSF glutamine levels in patients with MELAS syndrome. These findings may have potential therapeutic implications in these patients.

SCAF4-related syndromic intellectual disability.
The causal link between variants in the SCAF4 gene and a syndromic form of intellectual disability (ID) was established in 2020 by Fliedner et al. Since then, no additional cases have been reported. We performed exome sequencing in a 16-year-old Brazilian male presenting with ID, epilepsy, behavioral problems, speech impairment, facial dysmorphisms, heart malformations, and obesity. A de novo pathogenic variant [SCAF4(NM_020706.2):c.374_375dup(p.Glu126LeufsTer20)] was identified. This is the second study reporting the involvement of SCAF4 in syndromic ID, and the description of the patient's clinical features contributes to defining the phenotypic spectrum of this recently described Mendelian disorder.

Evaluation of AIIMS Modified INCLEN Tool for Diagnosis of Epilepsy.
To evaluate the AIIMS Modified INCLEN tool for the diagnosis of epilepsy.
This cross-sectional study enrolled 250 children aged 1 month to 18 years of age presenting with complaints of abnormal body movements to either the pediatric or neurology outpatient departments in our institution between October 1, 2018 and June 30, 2020. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) modified International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) diagnostic tool for epilepsy (AIIMS modified INDT-EPI) was administered and a diagnosis was made, which was further verified by a pediatrician or a neurologist. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.
The study tool had a sensitivity of 87.6% and specificity of 84.0%. The PPV and NPV of the study tool were 86.8% and 84.9% respectively.
The study tool has good psychometric properties for physician assessment with regard to diagnosis of epilepsy.

The efficacy and safety of ganaxolone for the treatment of refractory epilepsy: A meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials.
Epilepsy is one of the most common and refractory neurological disorders globally. Ganaxolone, a neuroactive steroid that enhances GABAergic inhibition, has been tested in many trials for the resolution of refractory epilepsy. Based on these, our study implemented a meta-analysis to evaluate the general benefit of ganaxolone for refractory epilepsy.
EMBASE, Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to June 20, 2022. The risk ratio (RR) and standard mean difference (SMD) were analyzed using dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively with a random effect model. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was also performed to judge the reliability of results.
We totally collected 659 patients from 4 RCTs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ganaxolone. As results showed, ≥50% reduction in mean seizure frequency has improved significantly compared with placebo (RR= 1.60, 95%CI: 1.02 to 2.49, P= 0.04, I

 = 30%), which is supported by TSA. However, the percentage of seizure-free days shows no statistical significance (p= 0.36). For safety outcomes, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events and AE leading to study drug discontinuation all revealed no obvious difference between ganaxolone and placebo (p>0.05).
Based on our research, we have observed that ganaxolone is safe and has potential efficacy in the treatment of refractory epilepsy, waiting for further studies.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Positive Airway Pressure Usage in Populations with Neurological Disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction during sleep, with a worldwide estimate of 936 million sufferers. Treatments of OSA include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), weight loss, positional therapy, oral appliances, positive upper airway pressure, oro-maxillofacial surgery, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, and bariatric surgery, and others, with CPAP being the most commonly prescribed treatment. In this review, the neurologic conditions of stroke, cognitive decline, epilepsy, and migraines will be discussed as they relate to OSA. Additionally, the literature regarding improvement in these conditions following treatment with CPAP will be explored.

Numbers and types of neurological emergencies in England and the influence of socioeconomic deprivation: a retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics data.
In this first large-scale analysis of neurological emergency admissions in England, we determine the number and types of emergency admissions with neurological emergency diagnostic codes, how many are under the care of a neurologist or neurosurgeon and how such admissions vary by levels of deprivation.
Retrospective empirical research employing a derived list of neurological emergency diagnostic codes SETTING: This study used the Hospital Episode Statistics data set for the financial year 2019/2020 based on 17 million in-year inpatient admissions in England including 6.5 million (100%) emergency admissions with any diagnosis codes.
There were 1.4 million (21.2%) emergency inpatient admissions with a mention of any neurological code, approx. 248 455 (3.8%) with mention of a specific neurological emergency code from the derived list, and 72 485 (1.1%) included such a code as the primary reason for admission. The highest number of in-year admissions for adults was for epilepsy (145 995), with epilepsy as the primary diagnostic code in 15 945 (10.9%). Acute nerve root/spinal cord syndrome (41 215), head injury (29 235) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (18 505) accounted for the next three highest number of admissions. 3230 (1.4%) in-year emergency hospital admissions with mention of a neurological emergency code were under the care of a neurologist or neurosurgeon, with only 1315 (0.9%) admissions with mention of an epilepsy code under a neurologist. There was significant variation for epilepsy and functional neurological disorders (FNDs) in particular by Index of Multiple Deprivation decile. The association between deprivation and epilepsy and FND was significant with p-values of 2.5e-6 and 1.5e-8, respectively.
This study has identified important findings in relation to the burden of neurological emergency admissions but further work is needed, with greater clinical engagement in diagnostic coding, to better understand the implications for workforce and changes to service delivery needing to be implemented.

Implantation of intracranial electrodes predicts worse outcome in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.
Anteromesial resection is an effective method for treating seizures arising from the medial temporal lobe, as these cases are often the most straightforward and have the best outcomes. Nevertheless, some patients who go on to have a mesial resection are recommended to have an implantation of electrodes before surgery. Whether the need for such an implant alters the rate of seizure-freedom is not well-studied in this particular subgroup of epilepsy patients.
We performed a retrospective review of consecutive anteromesial surgeries for medial temporal lobe epilepsy performed between 2005 and 2020. Of a total of thirty-nine patients, nineteen required electrode implantation (Electrode group) and twenty did not (No Electrode group). The primary outcomes assessed were reduction in seizure frequency and Engel score. Complication rates were also compared.
Post-resection seizure frequency reduction was non-significantly higher in the No Electrode group (97.0±10.3%) compared with the Electrode group (88.5±23.7%, p=0.15). The rate of Engel I outcome was non-significantly higher in the No Electrode group (84.2%) compared with the Electrode group (65.0%, p=0.17). Major complication rates were non-significantly higher in the No Electrode group (15.8±1.9%) compared with the Electrode group (5.0±1.1%, p=0.26). Power analysis revealed that 74 patients would need to be included in each group to reach statistical significance.
Although not statistically significant, our study showed a trend for improved seizure control if a decision was made not to implant electrodes prior to potentially curative anteromesial resection. Engel I outcome in this group reached approximately 85%. A larger multiinstiutional study may be required to reach statistical significance.

A single-cell transcriptome atlas of glial diversity in the human hippocampus across the postnatal lifespan.
The molecular diversity of glia in the human hippocampus and their temporal dynamics over the lifespan remain largely unknown. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to generate a transcriptome atlas of the human hippocampus across the postnatal lifespan. Detailed analyses of astrocytes, oligodendrocyte lineages, and microglia identified subpopulations with distinct molecular signatures and revealed their association with specific physiological functions, age-dependent changes in abundance, and disease relevance. We further characterized spatiotemporal heterogeneity of GFAP-enriched astrocyte subpopulations in the hippocampal formation using immunohistology. Leveraging glial subpopulation classifications as a reference map, we revealed the diversity of glia differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells and identified dysregulated genes and pathological processes in specific glial subpopulations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Together, our study significantly extends our understanding of human glial diversity, population dynamics across the postnatal lifespan, and dysregulation in AD and provides a reference atlas for stem-cell-based glial differentiation.

Interim results of adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment in BUTTERFLY - An observational study of children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment study assessments in a prospective study of patients with Dravet syndrome (DS). We present 3-month interim adaptive functioning and neurodevelopment data from the prospective, observational BUTTERFLY study in patients with DS aged 2-18 years.
BUTTERFLY enrolled thirty-six patients divided 1:1:1 across three age groups (2-7: 8-12: and 13-18 years). Most enrolled patients were female (61.1%), white (94.4%), and non-Latino (83.3%) with a mean (standard deviation; SD) age of 10.8 (5.2) years and a mean (range) age of seizure onset of 0.4 (0.2-1.0) years. Patients used a mean (SD) of 3.5 (1.63) anti-seizure therapies at baseline. Regression analysis of the baseline Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale - third edition (VABS-III) composite score indicated that the gap in adaptive function between patients with DS (n = 33) and neurotypical children widens with age. Similarly, developmental quotients calculated for patients who completed all Bayley Scales of Infant Development - third edition (BSID-III) subtests at baseline (n = 15) highlighted a gap in intellectual functioning between patients with DS and neurotypical children that widens with age. More patients in the two older age groups were able to validly complete the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - fourth edition (WPPSI-IV) at baseline compared with the youngest age group. There were trends towards higher raw scores, albeit of low magnitude, in the oldest age group compared with the younger age two groups across multiple VABS-III domains and WPPSI-IV subtests. All three measures showed no significant change in the all-patients analyses and demonstrated relatively low intra-patient variability from baseline to Month 3.
Three-month interim data from BUTTERFLY demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the VABS-III, BSID-III, and WPPSI-IV for the assessment of adaptive function and neurodevelopment in future clinical studies of DS. Moreover, many patients with DS appear to gain neurodevelopmental and adaptive function skills over time, although at a slower rate and lower magnitude than that seen in the neurotypical population.

A framework for health equity in people living with epilepsy.
Epilepsy is a disease where disparities and inequities in risk and outcomes are complex and multifactorial. While most epilepsy research to date has identified several key areas of disparities, we set out to provide a multilevel life course model of epilepsy development, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes to highlight how these disparities represent true inequities. Our piece also presents three hypothetical cases that highlight how the solutions to address inequities may vary across the lifespan. We then identify four key domains (structural, socio-cultural, health care, and physiological) that contribute to the persistence of inequities in epilepsy risk and outcomes in the United States. Each of these domains, and their core components in the context of epilepsy, are reviewed and discussed. Further, we highlight the connection between domains and key areas of intervention to strive towards health equity. The goal of this work is to highlight these domains while also providing epilepsy researchers and clinicians with broader context of how their work fits into health equity.

Spikes with and without concurrent high-frequency oscillations: Topographic relationship and neural correlates using EEG-fMRI.
Epilepsy surgery is the best therapeutic option for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. During presurgical investigation, interictal spikes can provide important information on eligibility, lateralisation and localisation of the surgical target. However, their relationship to epileptogenic tissue is variable. Interictal spikes with concurrent high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been postulated to reflect epileptogenic tissue more reliably. Here, we studied the voltage distribution of scalp-recorded spikes with and without concurrent HFO and identified their respective haemodynamic correlates using simultaneous electroencephalography and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (EEG-fMRI).
The scalp topography of spikes with and without concurrent HFOs were assessed in 31 consecutive patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy who showed interictal spikes during presurgical evaluation. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was then used in 17 patients with spikes and concurrent HFOs. Haemodynamic changes were obtained from the spatial correlation between the patient-specific voltage map of each spike population and the intra-scanner EEG. The haemodynamic response of spikes with and without HFOs were compared in terms of their spatial similarity, strength, the distance between activation peaks and concordance with interictal localisation.
Twenty-five patients showed spikes with and without concurrent HFOs. Among patients with both types of spikes, most spikes were not associated with HFOs (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). Twenty of the 25 patients showed an average of 8 ± 6 (standard deviation) electrodes with significant voltage differences (p = 0.025, permutation test corrected for multiple comparisons) on scalp electrodes within and distant to the spike field. Comparing the haemodynamic response between both spike populations, we found no significant differences in the peak strength (p = 0.71, Mann-Whitney test), spatial distribution (p = 0.113, One-sample Wilcoxon test) and distance between activation peaks (p = 0.5, One-sample Wilcoxon test), with all peaks being co-localised in the same lobe.
Our data showed that spikes with and without HFOs have different scalp voltage distributions. However, when assessing the haemodynamic changes of each spike type, we found that both elicit similar haemodynamic changes and share high spatial similarity suggesting that the epileptic networks of spikes with and without HFOs have the same underlying neural substrate.

Machine learning and statistic analysis to predict drug treatment outcome in pediatric epilepsy patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.
We aimed to investigate the association between multi-modality features and epilepsy drug treatment outcomes and propose a machine learning model to predict epilepsy drug treatment outcomes with multi-modality features.
This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 103 epilepsy children with rare TSC. Multi-modality data were used to characterize risk factors for epilepsy drug treatment outcome of TSC, including clinical data, TSC1, and TSC2 genes test results, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Three common feature selection methods and six common machine learning models were used to find the best combination of feature selection and machine learning model for epilepsy drug treatment outcomes prediction with multi-modality features for TSC clinical application.
The analysis of variance based on selected 35 features combined with multilayer perceptron (MLP) model achieved the best area-under-curve score (AUC) of 0.812 (±0.005). Infantile spasms, EEG discharge type, epileptiform discharge in the right frontal area of EEG, drug-resistant epilepsy, gene mutation type, and type II lesions were positively correlated with drug treatment outcome. Age of onset and age of visiting doctors were negatively correlated with drug treatment outcome (p < 0.05). Our machine learning results found that among MRI features, lesion type is the most important in the outcome prediction, followed by location and quantity.
We developed and validated an effective prediction model for epilepsy drug treatment outcomes of TSC. Our results suggested that multi-modality features analysis and MLP-based machine learning can predict epilepsy drug treatment outcomes of TSC.

The IN-MIDAZ study - Intranasal midazolam in aborting seizures - An epilepsy monitoring unit based randomized controlled trial for efficacy.
To compare efficacy and safety of Intranasal and Intramuscular routes of midazolam administration in terminating seizures.
This was an open label Randomized controlled trial (RCT). People with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) undergoing Video Electroencephalogram (VEEG) monitoring, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Intranasal (IN) or Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, for prolonged seizures: longer than 5 min for focal, and longer than 2 min for focal to bilateral tonic-clonic. Outcome assessor was blinded to the allocation arm. Primary outcome was time to electrographic seizure termination after administration of midazolam. All adverse events in both the groups were noted.
A total of 1108 seizures were recorded in 130 subjects, of which 110 (65 seizures in 23 subjects in IN group; 45 seizures in 18 subjects in IM group) seizures required midazolam administration and were included in final analysis. Mean time to electrographic seizure termination after midazolam administration was 45.1 ± 23.8 s in the IM group and 90.4 ± 59.0 s in the IN group (p = 0.0014); mean time to clinical seizure termination was 53.9 ± 25.8 s in IM group and 104.3 ± 66.4 s in the IN group (p = 0.002). Local side effects were more in IN group; hypotension as serious adverse event was noted in the IM group.
Though mean time to electrographic and clinical seizure termination was significantly lesser in Intramuscular group for both adults and pediatric population, it was still under 2 min in the Intranasal midazolam group.IN midazolam is a useful option for terminating seizures.

Being physically active with epilepsy: Insights from young people and their parents.
Researchers have called for innovative tailored interventions to address specific challenges to physical activity (PA) engagement for young people with epilepsy (YPE). Working with YPE and their parents, this study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to adoption and maintenance of PA among YPE prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ten YPE (all female) and their 13 caregivers, and five additional caregivers to males (N = 18; 72% mothers), completed virtual focus group sessions prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trained Child Life specialists asked questions about barriers and facilitators of PA engagement experienced by YWE, which included a specific focus on the impact of epilepsy.
Thematic analysis of the data identified both epilepsy-specific and generic themes that impact PA participation among YPE. These included: (i) epilepsy experience/impact and accommodation; (ii) safety precautions; (iii) concern about seizures; (iv) social connections and acceptance; (v) parent and family support; (vi) intrapersonal self-regulation and motivation; (vii) health benefits; and (viii) key factors in common with all youth.
This study provides valuable insight into diverse social-ecological health factors that impact PA participation among YPE from two key stakeholder perspectives (YPE and their caregivers). By understanding these lived experiences, providers can better tailor individual support for YPE and their families to foster and maintain a healthy active lifestyle.

Narrative review of brivaracetam for genetic generalized epilepsies.
The licensed treatment options for genetic generalized epilepsies are limited although many patients with these conditions require chronic pharmacological management with antiseizure medications and there are no curative surgical treatment options. Brivaracetam is being studied as a new therapeutic option for genetic generalized epilepsies.
In order to carry out a narrative review on the efficacy and safety of brivaracetam in genetic generalized epilepsies, a literature research was performed in Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Clinical Trials.gov databases.
Promising results were found with doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg/day in terms of efficacy (with > 50% responder rates between 36 and 84%), tolerability, and short and long-term safety (24-57% drug-associated adverse effects), with most studies reporting adequate retention rates and an absence of serious adverse effects, in monotherapy or as adjuvant therapy, even in refractory epilepsies, special populations and in patients with previous use and/or therapeutic failure with levetiracetam.
According to our review, brivaracetam is a valid treatment alternative in patients with genetic generalized epilepsies capable of improving patients' quality of life by reducing seizure frequency with minimal adverse effects.

Lennox Gastaut Syndrome - A strategic shift in diagnosis over time?
Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is an epilepsy syndrome presenting in childhood, classically characterised by a triad of cognitive or developmental impairment, multiple seizure types and EEG features of slow-spike waves (SWW), with or without paroxysmal fast activity (PFA) in sleep. There is increasing scientific opinion in favour of a less rigid approach to LGS diagnosis and this clinical audit attempts to shed light on how the LGS diagnostic criteria used may have changed over time, in a large tertiary paediatric neurology unit (Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London, UK).
Electronic patient records were reviewed for patients with a diagnosis of LGS made at GOSH within two time periods, 2014-2017 and 2018-2021. Patient demographics, aetiology, clinical features, EEG features, investigation results and medications were reviewed. Findings were compared against the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Diagnostic Manual criteria for LGS diagnosis (the classical triad plus PFA in sleep). Existing GOSH data regarding total number of new epilepsy referrals to GOSH and ICD10 codes (including all epilepsy and epilepsy syndromes) per year were also used to review LGS diagnoses as proportions of new epilepsy referrals and total number of epilepsy diagnoses.
5 LGS diagnoses were made in 2014-2017 compared to 40 diagnoses made in 2018-2021. There was a steep increase in the number of LGS diagnoses and LGS diagnoses as a proportion of total epilepsy diagnoses in the last 4 years, coinciding with the licensing of cannabidiol for management of LGS in the UK in 2018. There was a much less marked increase in LGS diagnoses as a proportion of epilepsy referrals from 2018 (and an as yet unexplained high proportion in 2014). The 2014-17 cohort fit a more classical LGS diagnostic criteria of the triad plus presence of PFA on sleep EEG (100% in 2014-17 vs 68% in 2018-21), with a more classical preceding history of infantile spasms (80% in 2014-17 vs 23% in 2018-21). Common seizure types were similar in both groups and a male preponderance was also noted in both groups. Cannabidiol use in LGS patients has also increased over time, all prescribed after 2018.
Despite the limitations of the small numbers of patients in each group, the results of this clinical audit are in keeping with changing clinical trends in favour of a broader LGS diagnostic criteria. The combination of this less rigid diagnostic criteria, the steep increase in diagnosis seen from 2018 onwards (coinciding with UK cannabidiol licencing for LGS in 2018) and the fact that most of the LGS patients in both groups are currently prescribed cannabidiol, may reflect a strategic shift in attitude towards LGS diagnosis or an increase in referrals for LGS, possibly to help facilitate access to novel treatments.

Seizure onset zone classification based on imbalanced iEEG with data augmentation.
Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is the critical information required for surgery. However, collecting this information is challenging, time-consuming, and subjective. Some machine learning methods reduce the workload of clinical experts in intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) visual diagnosis but face significant challenges because interictal iEEG clinical data often suffer from a significant class imbalance. We aim to generate synthetic data for the minority class.
To make the clinically imbalanced data suitable for machine learning, we introduce an EEG augmentation method (EEGAug). The EEGAug method randomly selects several samples from the minority class and transforms them into the frequency domain. Then, different frequency bands from different samples are used to compose new data. Finally, a synthetic sample is generated after converting the new data back to the time domain.
The imbalanced clinical iEEG data can be balanced and applied to machine learning models using the method. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model is used to classify the SOZ and non-SOZ data. We compare the EEGAug method with other data augmentation methods and another method of class-balanced (CB) focal loss function, which is also used for solving the data imbalance problem by adjusting the weights between the minority and majority classes. The results show that the EEGAug method performs best in most data.
Data imbalance is a widespread clinical problem. The EEGAug method can flexibly generate synthetic data for the minority class, yielding synthetic and raw data with a high distribution similarity. By using the EEGAug method, clinical data can be used in machine learning models.

SKF83959 Attenuates Memory Impairment and Depressive-like Behavior during the Latent Period of Epilepsy via Allosteric Activation of the Sigma-1 Receptor.
Memory impairment and emotional disorder are two common clinical comorbidities in patients with epilepsy. It is imperative to develop a novel therapeutic agent or a strategy. 6-Chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1-(3-methylphenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SKF83959) is a dopamine-1 receptor agonist and sigma-1 receptor allosteric modulator, which displays the neuron-protective and anti-neuroinflammation activity. We examined the effect of SKF83959 on the memory impairment and emotional disorder in the latent period of epilepsy using the mice post-status epilepticus model. We found that SKF83959 ameliorated memory impairment and depressive-like mood, alleviated the neuron damage and the formation of gliosis in hippocampus, suppressed the rise of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, and induced nitric oxide synthase in the latent period of epilepsy. Additionally, SKF83959 significantly inhibited the activity of calcineurin and glycogen synthase kinase-3β. All of these protective actions were reversed by BD1047 (a sigma-1 receptor antagonist). In addition, the intra-hippocampus injection of ketoconazole (a dehydroepiandrosterone synthesis inhibitor) also reversed the protective activity of SKF83959. Thus, we concluded that SKF83959 ameliorated the memory impairment and depressive-like mood in epilepsy via allosterically activating the sigma-1 receptor and subsequently inhibiting the calcineurin/glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway.

Expanding SPTAN1 monoallelic variant associated disorders: From epileptic encephalopathy to pure spastic paraplegia and ataxia.
Nonerythrocytic αII-spectrin (SPTAN1) variants have been previously associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy. We conducted this study to delineate the phenotypic spectrum of SPTAN1 variants.
We carried out SPTAN1 gene enrichment analysis in the rare disease component of the 100,000 Genomes Project and screened 100,000 Genomes Project, DECIPHER database, and GeneMatcher to identify individuals with SPTAN1 variants. Functional studies were performed on fibroblasts from 2 patients.
Statistically significant enrichment of rare (minor allele frequency < 1 × 10
-5
) probably damaging SPTAN1 variants was identified in families with hereditary ataxia (HA) or hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (12/1142 cases vs 52/23,847 controls, p = 2.8 × 10
-5
). We identified 31 individuals carrying SPTAN1 heterozygous variants or deletions. A total of 10 patients presented with pure or complex HSP/HA. The remaining 21 patients had developmental delay and seizures. Irregular αII-spectrin aggregation was noted in fibroblasts derived from 2 patients with p.(Arg19Trp) and p.(Glu2207del) variants.
We found that SPTAN1 is a genetic cause of neurodevelopmental disorder, which we classified into 3 distinct subgroups. The first comprises developmental epileptic encephalopathy. The second group exhibits milder phenotypes of developmental delay with or without seizures. The final group accounts for patients with pure or complex HSP/HA.

Functional Anterior Temporal Lobectomy for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: A Novel, Alternative, and Less Invasive Therapy.
Anterior temporal lobectomy is the most effective treatment for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, patients are reluctant to choose this surgery for fear of risks after large frontotemporal craniotomy, and epileptologists likewise have a cautious attitude because of surgical trauma. Functional anterior temporal lobectomy (FATL) is a minimally invasive surgery procedure for addressing the above concerns.
To report preliminary data on this procedure and its safety and efficacy for treating TLE.
This consecutive case series study was conducted between October 2020 and September 2021. Patients with TLE underwent FATL by minicraniotomy with a diameter of 3 cm. Surgery duration, postoperative complications, and seizure control are described herein. Seizure outcomes were classified using Engel classifications.
A total of 25 patients undergoing FATL for TLE were enrolled. The median epilepsy duration was 8 years. The median surgery duration was 165 min. The median blood loss was 100 mL. The median postoperative hospital stay was 8 days. No deaths occurred after surgery. Only 1 patient presented with a cerebrospinal fluid disorder that was successfully treated using a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. At the last follow-up, 23 patients (92%) were seizure-free (Engel-Ia), 1 patient remained substantially improved (Engel-II), and 1 patient obtained worthwhile seizure reduction (Engel-III).
Our pilot study suggests that FATL is a viable surgical therapy for TLE. This method has the advantages of minimal invasiveness and high seizure-free rate. A controlled trial is warranted to verify the efficacy and safety of FATL comparing with anterior temporal lobectomy.

Comparative economic outcomes in patients with focal seizures initiating eslicarbazepine acetate versus brivaracetam in the long-term care setting in the USA.
Aim:
 To compare all-cause and epilepsy-specific pharmacy and total costs associated with initiation of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) or brivaracetam (BRV) among patients with focal seizures in long-term care (LTC) in the US. 
Methods:
 This retrospective analysis used data from IQVIA's New Data Warehouse. 
Results:
 298 patients initiated ESL and 282 patients initiated BRV. Initiation of ESL versus BRV was associated with 33.3% lower all-cause pharmacy costs, 34.4% lower epilepsy-specific pharmacy costs, 21.3% lower all-cause total costs and 30.9% lower epilepsy-specific total costs (all p < 0.0001). 
Conclusion:
 Among patients with focal seizures in LTC in the US, initiation of ESL versus BRV was associated with significant reductions in all-cause and epilepsy-specific pharmacy and total costs compared with initiation of BRV.

Exosomal noncoding RNAs in prostate cancer.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of mortality among men. The recurrent reports of false-positive results of common PCa biomarkers have led to the introduction of some promising biomarkers for PCa, such as exosomal non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Exosomes contain various components, such as several ncRNAs (miRNAs and lncRNAs), which are important in the initiation and progression of PCa. These ncRNAs also reflect the state of the origin cell. In this article, we reviewed research on the importance and roles of ncRNAs in PCa, focusing on exosomal ncRNAs. We highlighted plasma exosomal miRNAs (8 miRNAs), urine exosomal miRNAs (19miRNAs), serum miRNAs (2 miRNAs), and five miRNAs in semen used for PCa diagnosis. Also, four exosomal lncRNAs in plasma and urine can be used as biomarkers for PCa diagnosis.

Clinical characterization of epileptic seizures in Pomeranians with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy of unknown cause.
Focal epileptic motor seizures manifested by limb contraction have been recognized anecdotally in Pomeranians.
To investigate clinical features of idiopathic epilepsy (IE) and epilepsy of unknown cause (EUC) in Pomeranians as well as the ADAM23 haplotype frequency previously reported as a common risk haplotype for epilepsy in several breeds of dogs.
Twenty-eight Pomeranians, including 15 with IE and 13 with EUC. Nine Pomeranians with epilepsy and 8 control Pomeranians were used for ADAM23 risk haplotype analysis.
Case series study including both retrospectively and prospectively collected cases. The ADAM23 haplotype was determined by direct sequencing of PCR amplicons. Data were analyzed descriptively.
Focal epileptic seizures (FS) were the predominant type of seizure in 22 of 28 dogs (78.6%). Among these, 12 of the IE dogs (80.0%) and 10 of the EUC dogs (76.9%) showed FS. Notably, 21 of 22 Pomeranians with FS (95.5%) showed limb contraction during ictal periods. Some dogs with FS also showed immobility, generalized tremors, difficulty walking or moving, autonomic signs, orofacial automatisms or some combination during ictal events. Ten dogs with FS and limb contraction had electroencephalography (EEG) performed, and interictal epileptiform discharges were identified in 9 dogs. The haplotype frequency of ADAM23 in cases was lower (27.8%) than that of the controls (56.3%).
In our study, FS was the predominant type of seizure in Pomeranians, and almost all cases with FS showed limb contraction, regardless of whether having IE or EUC.

Factors associated with acute care service use after epilepsy hospitalisation in people with intellectual disability.
This study aimed to identify factors associated with unplanned acute hospital readmission and emergency department (ED) presentation after hospitalisation for epilepsy in people with intellectual disability (ID).
This study is a retrospective cohort study using linked administrative datasets. We identified 3293 people with ID aged 5-64 years with a hospitalisation for epilepsy between 2005 and 2014 in New South Wales, Australia. We examined unplanned readmission and ED presentation within 30 or 365 days and associations with demographic, socio-economic and health status variables. Modified Poisson regression with robust estimation was used to model outcomes within 30 days. Negative binomial regression was used to account for the overdispersion of the data and to model 365-day outcome rates.
Around half of the cohort had an unplanned readmission and ED presentation within 365 days of the index hospitalisation. In fully adjusted models, being female, being a young adult and having a longer or acute care index admission, mental and physical comorbidities and a history of incarceration were associated with an elevated risk of readmission or ED presentation. The strongest association was observed between history of self-harm and 365-day readmission (incidence rate ratio 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.41-3.29).
Socio-demographic, justice and health factors are associated with unplanned readmission and ED presentation risk after hospitalisation for epilepsy in people with ID. Interventions targeting improving continuity of care should be tailored for individuals and their support workers. The findings also emphasise the importance of person-centred multidisciplinary care across different health sectors.

Identification of mRNA expression biomarkers associated with epilepsy and response to valproate with co-expression analysis.
Valproate (VPA) resistance was reported to be an important predictor of intractable epilepsy. We conducted this study to identify candidate biomarkers in peripheral blood correlated with VPA resistance.
The microarray dataset (GSE143272) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to construct co-expression modules and obtain the most prominent module associated with VPA resistance. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between VPA-responsive and VPA-resistant patients were obtained using the "Limma" package in R. The intersections between the most prominent module and DEGs were identified as target genes. Metascape was performed to discover the possible involved pathways of the target genes. GeneCards database was used to know the function of each target gene.
All genes in the GSE143272 were divided into 24 different modules. Among these modules, the darkred module showed a pivotal correlation with VPA resistance. A total of 70 DEGs between VPA-responsive and VPA-resistant patients were identified. After taking the intersection, 25 target genes were obtained. The 25 target genes were significantly enriched in T cell receptor recognition, T cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation of T cell activation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and 
in utero
 embryonic development. Half of the target genes (
CD3D, CD3G, CXCR3, CXCR6, GATA3, GZMK, IL7R, LIME1, SIRPG, THEMIS, TRAT1
, and 
ZNF683
) were directly involved in the T cell development, migration, and activation signaling pathway.
We identified 25 target genes prominently associated with VPA resistance, which could be potential candidate biomarkers for epilepsy resistance in peripheral blood. The peripheral blood T cells may play a crucial role in VPA resistance. Those genes and pathways might become therapeutic targets with clinical usefulness in the future.

High end-of-life incidence of seizures and status epilepticus in patients with primary and secondary brain tumors.
Seizures pose a significant burden in patients with primary and secondary brain tumors during the end-of-life period. A wide range of 6 to 56% of clinically observed epileptic seizures at the end of life has been reported. We aimed to analyse the incidence of epileptic seizures at the end of life in brain tumor patients more accurately using not only clinical but also electrophysiological findings.
This retrospective, single center study included brain tumor patients who died during the stay on the ward or within 7 days after discharge between 01/2015 and 08/2020. Clinical observation of seizures derived from the original medical records and EEG findings (within 45 days prior to death) were analyzed to determine the incidence of seizures in that period.
Of the 68 eligible patients, 50 patients (73.5%) suffered from seizures within 45 days prior to death, of which n = 24 had a status epilepticus. The diagnosis of seizures/ status epilepticus was determined either by the presentation of clinical signs in 45 patients and if not, by the detection of a (possible) non-convulsive status epilepticus in the EEG of five patients.
In the presence of neurologically trained staff and with the frequent use of routine EEG, we were able to identify seizures and to distinguish status epilepticus from encephalopathy/ hypoactive delirium. We detected a higher incidence of seizures and status epilepticus at the end of life in neurooncological patients than previously reported.

Infraclinical detection of voluntary attention in coma and post-coma patients using electrophysiology.
Early functional evaluation and prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousness is a major challenge that clinical assessments alone cannot solve. Objective measures of brain activity could help resolve this uncertainty. We used electroencephalogram at bedside to detect voluntary attention with a paradigm previously validated in healthy subjects.
Using auditory-oddball sequences, our approach rests on detecting known attentional modulations of Event Related Potentials that reflect compliance with verbal instructions. Sixty-eight unresponsive patients were tested in their first year after coma onset (37 coma and 31 first year post-coma patients). Their evolution 6 months after the test was considered.
Fourteen of the 68 patients, showed a positive response. Nine were in a coma and 5 in a minimally conscious state (MCS). Except for one who died early, all responders evolved to exit-MCS within 6 months (93%), while 35 (65%) among non-responders only.
Among those patients for whom the outcome is highly uncertain, 21% responded positively to this simple but cognitively demanding test. Strikingly, some coma patients were among responders.
The proposed paradigm revealed cognitive-motor dissociation in some coma patients. This ability to sustain attention on demand predicted awakening within 6 months and represents an immediately useful information for relatives and caregivers.

Infant with Loeys-Dietz syndrome treated for febrile status epilepticus with COVID-19 infection: first reported case of febrile status epilepticus and focal seizures in a patient with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and review of literature.
Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a rare, autosomal dominant multisystem disorder that is caused by mutations of transforming growth factor-β receptors. Mutations in 
SMAD3
 and 
TGFB3
 have been recently reported.LDS is characterised by the triad of arterial tortuosity, hypertelorism and a bifid uvula or cleft palate among other cardiovascular, craniofacial and orthopaedic manifestations. Patients with LDS show clinical and genetic variability and there is a significant risk of reduced life expectancy due to widespread arterial involvement, aortic root dilation, aneurysms and an aggressive vascular course. Thus early genetic testing is warranted if clinical signs and history are suggestive of this potentially catastrophic disorder.LDS predisposes patients to aortic aneurysms and early death due to vascular malformations, but neurological emergencies, such as seizures and febrile status epilepticus, have not been reported.Febrile status epilepticus is the most common neurological emergency in childhood. Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in the paediatric population are not as well described in medical literature.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of febrile status epilepticus with COVID-19 infection in an infant with LDS. Our patient had focal epileptiform activity emanating over the left posterior hemisphere, which evolved into an electrographic seizure on video EEG. Such patients have a heightened risk of epilepsy in the future, and this occurrence is consistent with a diagnosis of focal epilepsy. Neurological complications such as epilepsy and status epilepticus in a patient with LDS have never been reported before.A brief review of literature is also given here.

Prediction of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy from healthy controls using machine learning from scalp EEG recordings.
Epilepsy detection is essential for patients with epilepsy and their families, as well as for researchers and medical staff. The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) as a tool to support the diagnosis of patients with epilepsy is fundamental. Today, machine learning (ML) techniques are widely applied in neuroscience. The main objective of our study is to differentiate patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy from healthy controls by applying machine learning techniques on interictal electroencephalographic recordings. Our research predicts which patients have idiopathic generalized epilepsy from a scalp EEG study. In addition, this study focuses on using the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) method applied to scalp EEG. XGB is one of the variants of gradient boosting and is a supervised learning algorithm. This type of system is developed to increase performance and processing speed. Through this proposed method, an attempt is made to recognize patterns from scalp EEG recordings that would allow the detection of IGE with high accuracy and differentiate IGE patients from healthy controls, creating an additional tool to support clinicians in their decision-making. Among the ML methods applied, the proposed XGB method achieves a better prediction of the distinct features in EEG signals from patients with IGE. XGB was 6.26% more accurate than the k-Nearest Neighbours method and was more accurate than the support vector machine (10.61%), decision tree (9.71%) and Gaussian Naïve Bayes (11.83%). Besides, the proposed XGB method showed the highest area under the curve (AUC 98%) and balanced accuracy (98.13%) of all methods tested. Application of ML technique in EEG of patients with epilepsy is very recent and is emerging with promising results. In this research work, we showed the usefulness of ML techniques to identify and predict generalized epilepsy from healthy controls in scalp EEG studies. These findings could help develop automated tools that integrate these ML techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating between patients with IGE from healthy controls in daily practice.

Role of P2Y receptors in astrocyte physiology and pathophysiology.
Astrocytes are active constituents of the brain that manage ion homeostasis and metabolic support of neurons and directly tune synaptic transmission and plasticity. Astrocytes express all known P2Y receptors. These regulate a multitude of physiological functions such as cell proliferation, Ca
2+
 signalling, gliotransmitter release and neurovascular coupling. In addition, P2Y receptors are fundamental in the transition of astrocytes into reactive astrocytes, as occuring in many brain disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, neuroinflammation and epilepsy. This review summarizes the current literature addressing the function of P2Y receptors in astrocytes in the healthy brain as well as in brain diseases.

Meta-analysis of the risk of dementia in elderly patients with late-onset epilepsy.
Although available literature indicates a high risk of dementia in elderly patients with late-onset epilepsy (LOE), the findings are yet inconsistent and relevant risk factors are unclear, rendering rational clinical interpretation rather challenging. This article systematically evaluates the risk of dementia in elderly LOE patients. The potential risk factors were analyzed to provide a specific basis for clinical prediction of dementia. PubMed and web of science databases were searched for the published cohort studies of dementia in elderly LOE patients. The search results were subject to a meta-analysis with Stata16.0 statistical software. Seven articles were included for a comparison of dementia risk between epilepsy cases and controls, yielding a hazard ration (HR) of 2.1 (95 %CI：1.6～2.75，p = 0.00); dementia was more prevalent in female patients than in male counterparts, though without a statistical difference [1.2 % (95 %CI, 0.9 %-1.6 %) vs. 0.8 % (95 %CI, 0.5 %-1.1 %)]; compared with the non-LOE group, the LOE population reported a significantly higher incidence of diabetes mellitus [14.1 % (95 %CI, 12.8 %-15.4 %) vs. 10.9 % (95 %CI, 10.1 %-11 %), p < 0.01]. The findings suggest that elderly patients with late-onset epilepsy run a higher risk of dementia than non-epileptic patients and diabetes mellitus may serve as a potential risk factor for dementia in this elderly populace.

Synthetic relaxometry combined with MUSE DWI and 3D-pCASL improves detection of hippocampal sclerosis.
To investigate the diagnostic value of synthetic MRI combined MUSE DWI and 3D-pCASL in hippocampal sclerosis (HS).
A total of 30 HS patients participated in the study. At the same time, 51 healthy volunteers were collected as the control group. All patients and healthy volunteers underwent epilepsy MR scanning protocol (including oblique coronal MAGiC, MUSE DWI, and axial 3D-pCASL) at 3.0 T MR scanner.The independent samples T test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the differences of the apparent dispersion coefficient(ADC), cerebral blood flow(CBF) and quantitative parameters, including T1 relaxation time (T1), T2 relaxation time (T2), and proton density (PD) values, in the hippocampus of the affected side of HS and the contralateral and control groups, respectively. The diagnostic performance was evaluated using binary logistic regression analysis and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC).
Significant statistical differences in T1, T2, CBF, and ADC values were observed between the affected hippocampus of HS patients and contralateral and control hippocampus (all P < 0.005). The T2 has higher discrimination abilities compared with other univariable parameters, with the AUC of 0.899. The combined T2, ADC and CBF model had the best diagnostic performance of HS in MTLE patients with AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.946, 86.67 %, 93.33 %, respectively.
Relaxometry parameters derived from synthetic MRI contributed to diagnosis of HS. The proposed approach combining T2, ADC and CBF showed a strong diagnostic capability.

Invasive neuromodulation for epilepsy: Comparison of multiple approaches from a single center.
Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients not amenable to epilepsy surgery can benefit from neurostimulation. Few data compare different neuromodulation strategies.
Compare five invasive neuromodulation strategies for the treatment of DRE: anterior thalamic nuclei deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS), centromedian thalamic nuclei DBS (CM-DBS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), chronic subthreshold stimulation (CSS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).
Single center retrospective review and phone survey for patients implanted with invasive neuromodulation for 2004-2021.
N = 159 (ANT-DBS = 38, CM-DBS = 19, RNS = 30, CSS = 32, VNS = 40). Total median seizure reduction (MSR) was 61 % for the entire cohort (IQR 5-90) and in descending order: CSS (85 %), CM-DBS (63 %), ANT-DBS (52 %), RNS (50 %), and VNS (50 %); p = 0.07. The responder rate was 60 % after a median follow-up time of 26 months. Seizure severity, life satisfaction, and quality of sleep were improved. Cortical stimulation (RNS and CSS) was associated with improved seizure reduction compared to subcortical stimulation (ANT-DBS, CM-DBS, and VNS) (67 % vs. 52 %). Effectiveness was similar for focal epilepsy vs. generalized epilepsy, closed-loop vs. open-loop stimulation, pediatric vs. adult cases, and high frequency (>100 Hz) vs. low frequency (<100 Hz) stimulation settings. Delivered charge per hour varied widely across approaches but was not correlated with improved seizure reduction.
Multiple invasive neuromodulation approaches are available to treat DRE, but little evidence compares the approaches. This study used a uniform approach for single-center results and represents an effort to compare neuromodulation approaches.

Outcomes from a Spanish Expanded Access Program on cannabidiol treatment in pediatric and adult patients with epilepsy.
To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of cannabidiol (CBD) in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome (DS), and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), in a Spanish Expanded Access Program (EAP).
This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study of patients treated with purified CBD in 14 hospitals across Spain. Patients with (1) written informed consent and (2) at least 6 months follow-up before the closure of the database were included. Primary effectiveness endpoints included reductions (100 %, ≥75 %, ≥50 %, ≥25 %, or 0 %) or worsening in seizure frequency (all seizure types and most disabling seizures) at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month visits and at the last visit, and median relative seizure reduction between baseline and last visit. Secondary effectiveness endpoints included retention rate, reduction in seizure severity, status epilepticus, healthcare utilization, and quality of life. Primary safety endpoints included rates of adverse events (AEs) and AEs leading to discontinuation.
One hundred and two patients (DS 12 %; LGS 59 %; other epilepsy syndromes 29 %) with a mean age of 15.9 years were enrolled. Patients were highly refractory to antiseizure medications (ASMs); mean number of prior failed ASMs was 7.5 (SD 3.7). The mean CBD dose was 13.0 mg/kg/day at the last visit. The proportion of patients with ≥50 % reduction in the total number of seizures from baseline was 44.9 % at 6 months and 38.9 % at 12 months. The median number of total seizures per month reduced by 47.6 % from baseline to the last visit. At 12 months, seizure severity was lower in 33/54 patients (61.1 %) and unchanged in 17/54 patients (31.5 %). Quality of life, based on the CAVE scale, increased from a mean score of 17.9 ± 4.7 (n = 54) at baseline to 21.7 ± 5.5 (n = 51) at the last patient visit (21.2 % improvement). The mean treatment retention time was 10.3 months. There were no statistically significant changes in the number of status epilepticus episodes, but lower healthcare utilization was observed. Adverse events occurred in sixty-eight patients (66.7 %), and the most common were somnolence (34.3 %) and diarrhea (12.7 %). Cannabidiol was discontinued exclusively due to AEs in 7.8 % of patients, increasing to 25.5 % when both lack of efficacy and AEs were considered together.
Cannabidiol demonstrated promising effectiveness and tolerability in patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies taking part in a Spanish EAP.

Effectiveness and tolerability of adjunctive perampanel in the treatment of pediatric patients with uncontrolled epilepsy: A retrospective, single-center, real-world study.
The main aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of adjunctive perampanel (PER) in the treatment of children and adolescents with epilepsy.
Pediatric patients who visited the pediatric epilepsy clinic of Henan Provincial People's Hospital between May 2020 and December 2021 were recruited. All participants were treated with PER as adjunctive therapy and were seen routinely (minimum: a baseline and 12-week visit). The efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive PER for the treatment of epilepsy were investigated.
One hundred and fourteen patients were enrolled, among whom 7 (6.1%) were lost to follow-up. At 12 weeks, the responder rate and the seizure-free rate were 56.1% (60/107) and 32.7% (35/107), respectively. The responder rate increased with the duration of PER administration and was significantly higher when PER was used as an early add-on (after ≤2 prior antiseizure medications (ASMs)) than a late add-on (after >2 prior ASMs). However, there was no significant difference in the treatment efficacy of adjunctive PER in patients with different epilepsy etiologies or types. Adverse events, including irritability, dizziness, somnolence, ataxic gait, weight gain, and tinnitus, were reported in thirty-two patients (29.9%).
In a routine clinical setting of pediatric patients with epilepsy, good effectiveness and tolerability of adjunctive PER were demonstrated. Notably, patients initiating PER as an early add-on showed a better seizure outcome than those initiating PER as a late add-on.

30-Day readmission rates in pediatric patients with functional seizures.
To ascertain the rates of 30-day readmissions and emergency department presentations among pediatric patients with an index admission for functional seizures.
A retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with an index discharge from the pediatric epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) or general neurology service for functional seizures. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, risk factors, and treatment during the index admission.
A total of one hundred and two patients were included, of which nearly one in five had a 30-day readmission or emergency department presentation. Index admission to the general neurology service was independently associated with more re-presentations to the hospital (t = 3.26, p < 0.0015). The univariate analysis indicated that cognitive impairment and autism were associated with a lower likelihood of readmission, while a neurology referral and being started on an anti-seizure medication were associated with a greater likelihood of readmission.
A substantial proportion of pediatric patients with FS return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. Our data suggest that patients admitted to the EMU service have a lower likelihood of readmission. We speculate that this may be due to differences in patient clinical characteristics as well as the comprehensiveness of the diagnostic evaluation and management in the EMU compared to the general neurology service.

Parents' opinions about epilepsy surgery in children with epilepsy.
This survey aimed to investigate the opinions of the parents of children with epilepsy with regard to the application of epilepsy surgery for their children.
We surveyed all the parents of children with epilepsy referred to our neurology clinic (Shiraz University of Medical Sciences) in April-July 2022. We collected their opinions about epilepsy surgery based on a predesigned questionnaire. The inclusion criteria included parents of all children with epilepsy (1 to 16 years of age, with at least one-year history of epilepsy, and with at least one drug used in the past 12 months).
In total, 472 people participated in the study; 277 participants (58.7%) were willing to have epilepsy surgery for their child; the most common reason was to be able to discontinue the drugs. Sex (male), age (younger), and education (college) of the parents had significant associations with the parental willingness to have surgery for their children. The patient's drug regimen (polytherapy) and history of ictal injury (in the child) also had significant associations with the parental willingness to have surgery for the children.
Most parents of children with epilepsy are willing to have epilepsy surgery for their children if their physician presents epilepsy surgery to them as an established, safe, and effective treatment option. Patient and parental-related factors should be considered when designing educational materials and programs for preoperative counseling for the parents of children with drug-resistant seizures.

The association of multiple chronic conditions and healthcare expenditures among adults with epilepsy in the United States.
Epilepsy is a frequent neurologic condition with important financial strains on the US healthcare system. The co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) may have additional financial repercussions on this patient population. We aimed to assess the association of coexisting chronic conditions on healthcare expenditures among adult patients with epilepsy.
We identified a total of 1,942,413 adults (≥18 years) with epilepsy using the clinical classification code 83 from the MEPS-HC (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component) database between 2003 and 2014. Chronic conditions were selected using the clinical classification system (ccs), and categorized into 0, 1, or 2 chronic conditions in addition to epilepsy. We computed unadjusted healthcare expenditures per year and per individual (total direct healthcare expenditure, inpatient expenditure, outpatient expenditure, prescription medication expenditure, emergency room visit expenditure, home healthcare expenditure and other) by number of chronic conditions. We applied a two-part model with probit (probability of zero vs non-zero cost) and generalized linear model (GLM) gamma family and log link (for cost greater than zero) to examine the independent association between chronic conditions, and annual expenditures per individual, generating incremental costs with 0 chronic condition as reference.
Over half of the patients with epilepsy had at least two chronic conditions (CC). Yearly, for each patient with one and two chronic conditions, unadjusted total healthcare expenditures were two times ($10,202; 95 %CI $6,551-13,853) to nearly three times ($21,277; 95 %CI $12,971-25,583) higher than those with no chronic conditions ($6,177; 95 %CI $4,895-7,459), respectively. In general healthcare expenditures increased with the number of chronic conditions for pre-specified cost categories. The incremental (adjusted) total healthcare expenditure increased with the number of chronic conditions (1CC vs 0 CC: $3,238; 95 %CI $524-5,851 p-value = 0.015 and ≥2 CC vs 0 CC: $8,145; 95 %CI $5,935-10,895 p-value < 0.001). In general, for all cost categories, incremental healthcare expenditures increased with the number of chronic conditions with the largest increment noted between those with 2 CC and those with 0 CC for inpatient ($2,025: 95 %CI $867-3,1830), outpatient ($2,141; 95 %CI $1,321-2,962), and medication ($1,852; 95 %CI $1,393-2,310).
Chronic conditions are frequent among adult patients with epilepsy and are associated with a dose-response increase in healthcare expenditure, a difference driven by inpatient, outpatient, and medication prescription expenditures. Greater coordination of epilepsy care accounting for the presence of multiple chronic conditions may help lower the cost of epilepsy.

Intermediate stimulation frequencies for language mapping using stereo-"EEG.
Identification of eloquent cortices is a prerequisite for the surgical plan but may be challenging, in particular for language areas (LAs), considering the complexity of language function and organization. Electrical intracerebral stimulations (ES) during Stereo-electroencephalography are an essential tool in the localization of LAs and high frequency ES (HFS, 50 Hz) are current gold standard. Low frequencies (1 Hz) are not effective. We aim to investigate different ES frequencies for establishing their utility in localizing LAs.
We implemented an observational and prospective study evaluating frequencies lower than 50 and higher than 1 Hz; indicated as "intermediate" frequencies (IFS) performed at 6, 9 and 12 Hz and lasting 15 seconds. We included ten patients and carried out a standardized protocol comparing IFS to HFS.
Eighty-six ES were carried out in LAs, positive for a language interference in 61.6% without noteworthy difference between IFS and HFS. Among these, 53.3% IFS vs 21.7% HFS yielded no after-discharge.
IFS were similarly effective as HFS, with lower incidence of ADs. Their longer duration facilitated more accurate clinical testing.
Our results are promising, suggesting that IFS can be useful in the study of LAs.

Thalamocortical coherence and causality in different sleep stages using deep brain stimulation recordings.
Previous research has shown an interplay between the thalamus and cerebral cortex during NREM sleep in humans, however the directionality of the thalamocortical synchronization is as yet unknown. In this study thalamocortical connectivity during different NREM sleep stages using sleep scalp electroencephalograms and local field potentials from the left and right anterior thalamus was measured in three epilepsy patients implanted with deep brain stimulation electrodes. Connectivity was assessed as debiased weighted phase lag index and granger causality between the thalamus and cortex for the NREM sleep stages N1, N2 and N3. Results showed connectivity was most prominently directed from cortex to thalamus. Moreover, connectivity varied in strength between the different sleep stages, but barely in direction or frequency. These results imply relatively stable thalamocortical connectivity during NREM sleep directed from the cortex to the thalamus.

Nonpharmacological interventions for treating fatigue in adolescents: A systematic review and narrative synthesis of randomised controlled trials.
Fatigue is common in adolescence and can be highly disabling if experienced persistently, with adverse psychosocial outcomes. There is a need to better understand what nonpharmacological treatments are available for adolescents suffering with persistent fatigue. The current review systematically identified, synthesised, and evaluated the evidence regarding nonpharmacological interventions for fatigue in adolescents, focusing on evaluating effectiveness, describing intervention components, and mapping interventions onto the behaviour change technique taxonomy (BCTT).
CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science were systematically searched for articles including (1) adolescents aged 10-19 years old, (2) fatigue as a primary or secondary outcome, (3) nonpharmacological interventions, and (4) randomised controlled trials. Study screening, data extraction, quality assessment, and BCTT mapping were performed independently by two reviewers. Findings were presented as a narrative synthesis, with interventions ranked by promise.
5626 papers were identified and double-screened, resulting in the inclusion of 21 articles reporting 16 trials. Five interventions were classified as likely promising. Interventions often involved psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy, and/or physical activity, incorporating various BCTT domains, most commonly shaping knowledge, repetition and substitution, and goals and planning. However, there did not seem to be any observable differences between fatigue-targeted and non-fatigue-targeted interventions. Overall study quality was mixed, particularly in relation to power and outcome measures.
There are several promising nonpharmacological interventions for adolescent fatigue, although further work is needed to determine effectiveness. Future trials need to ensure design rigour, focusing on adequate powering, validated outcome measures, and adhering to best practice reporting guidelines.

Brain Complexity Predicts Response to Adrenocorticotropic Hormone in Infantile Epileptic Spasms Syndrome: A Retrospective Study.
Infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) is an age-specific and severe epileptic encephalopathy. Although adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is currently considered the preferred first-line treatment, it is not always effective and may cause side effects. Therefore, seeking a reliable biomarker to predict the treatment response could benefit clinicians in modifying treatment options.
In this study, the complexities of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from 15 control subjects and 40 patients with IESS before and after ACTH therapy were retrospectively reviewed using multiscale entropy (MSE). These 40 patients were divided into responders and nonresponders according to their responses to ACTH.
The EEG complexities of the patients with IESS were significantly lower than those of the healthy controls. A favorable response to treatment showed increasing complexity in the γ band but exhibited a reduction in the β/α-frequency band, and again significantly elevated in the δ band, wherein the latter was prominent in the parieto-occipital regions in particular. Greater reduction in complexity was significantly linked with poorer prognosis in general. Occipital EEG complexities in the γ band revealed optimized performance in recognizing response to the treatment, corresponding to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves as 0.8621, while complexities of the δ band served as a fair predictor of unfavorable outcomes globally.
We suggest that optimizing frequency-specific complexities over critical brain regions may be a promising strategy to facilitate predicting treatment response in IESS.

The neurodevelopmental profile of healthy children with premature anterior fontanel closure.
We aimed to assess the neurodevelopmental status of healthy children with premature anterior fontanel closure.
This retrospective observational study was conducted on 40 (20 M, 20 F) children admitted to Mersin University Pediatric Neurology Outpatient Clinic between 2015-2020 with complaints of premature fontanel closure. Patients with dysmorphic features, microcephaly, craniosynostosis, hypoxic-ischemic sequelae, infections, metabolic disorders, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, endocrine problems, additional congenital anomalies, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), prematurity, and postmaturity were excluded. The Denver II and Bayley III tests were applied to all patients and controls.
The Denver II identified retardations in gross motor skills (p = 0.015) and personal-social skills (p = 0.042) and Bayley III in cognitive (p = 0.030) and motor skills (p = 0.007) in the study group. None of the participants in the study group had neurodevelopmental retardation, according to the Bayley III normal standards.
Our results suggest that children with premature fontanel closure may develop motor retardation. These children should, therefore, be closely monitored for neurodevelopmental aspects.

Executive functions and personality traits of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients: a single-center experience of 23 cases.
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), which is a fairly common form of generalized epilepsy syndrome has attracted attention by providing focal findings in some electrophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging studies. These findings are considered to be based on frontal lobe dysfunction. Furthermore, it is known that Cluster B personality disorders that are related to impulsive behavior are frequently seen in JME patients.
In this study, 23 JME patients and 20 healthy control subjects were included. All subjects were assessed using neuropsychological tests for executive functions and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) for personality traits.
JME patients performed poorly in the digit span test and the Stroop Color and Word Interference Test. When the TCI scores were compared, there was no significant difference between the patients and the control subjects compatible with the literature. In addi-tion, cooperativeness-character dimension (C1-social acceptance) scores were significantly lower in the patient group.
Our findings support that JME patients have frontal lobe dysfunction. Although several studies are available in the literature, no significant results related to personality traits were detected.

Intracranial human recordings reveal association between neural activity and perceived intensity for the pain of others in the insula.
Based on neuroimaging data, the insula is considered important for people to empathize with the pain of others. Here we present intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings and single-cell recordings from the human insulae while 7 epilepsy patients rated the intensity of a woman's painful experiences seen in short movie clips. Pain had to be deduced from seeing facial expressions or a hand being slapped by a belt. We found activity in the broadband 20-190 Hz range correlated with the trial-by-trial perceived intensity in the insula for both types of stimuli. Within the insula, some locations had activity correlating with perceived intensity for our facial expressions but not for our hand stimuli, others only for our hand but not our face stimuli, and others for both. The timing of responses to the sight of the hand being hit is best explained by kinematic information; that for our facial expressions, by shape information. Comparing the broadband activity in the iEEG signal with spiking activity from a small number of neurons and an fMRI experiment with similar stimuli, revealed a consistent spatial organization, with stronger associations with intensity more anteriorly, while viewing the hand being slapped.

Treatment with topiramate in rats during childhood causes testicular structural impairment at adulthood.
Topiramate (TOP) is a psychotropic drug prescribed for the treatment of epilepsy in children older than 2 years of age and for migraine prophylaxis in adolescents. There is evidence that TOP promotes negative effects on the reproductive system of male rats. This study aimed to evaluate the immediate and late treatment effects of TOP during childhood and adolescence on the male rat reproductive system. Two experimental groups received 41 mg/kg of TOP daily, by gavage, from postnatal day (PND) 16 to 28 (TOPc group) or from PND 28 to 50 (TOPa group). Control groups (CTRc group or CTRa group) received water daily. Half of the anim-als were evaluated 24 h after the end of treatment (PND 29 and PND 51, respectively) and the remainder were evaluated in adulthood (PND120). The following parameters were determined: anogenital distance, sperm evaluation, testis' histomorphometry and plasma testosterone concentration. At PND 120, the volume (CTRc:62.58 ± 2.13; TOPc: 54.54 ± 2.10*%, 
p
 = 0.018) and total length (CTRc: 25.48 ± 1.61; TOPc: 18.94 ± 2.41*, 
p
 = 0.035) of seminiferous tubules were decreased and the volume of interstitial tissue (CTRc:37.41 ± 2.13; TOPc: 45.45 ± 2.09*%, 
p
 = 0.018) and number of Leydig cells/testis (CTRc: 277.00 ± 36.70; TOPc: 400.20 ± 13.23*, 
p
 = 0.013) were increased in the TOPc group. The other parameters remained similar between the groups. Therefore, the present study contributes to our understanding that childhood treatment with TOP has an impact on the rat reproductive system in adulthood, suggesting that this period is more sensitive to TOP exposure than adolescence.

The clinical spectrum of SMA-PME and in vitro normalization of its cellular ceramide profile.
The objectives of this study were to define the clinical and biochemical spectrum of spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) and to determine if aberrant cellular ceramide accumulation could be normalized by enzyme replacement.
Clinical features of 6 patients with SMA-PME were assessed by retrospective chart review, and a literature review of 24 previously published cases was performed. Leukocyte enzyme activity of acid ceramidase was assessed with a fluorescence-based assay. Skin fibroblast ceramide content and was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectroscopy. Enzyme replacement was assessed using recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC) in vitro.
The six new patients showed the hallmark features of SMA-PME, with variable initial symptom and age of onset. Five of six patients carried at least one of the recurrent SMA-PME variants observed in two specific codons of ASAH1. A review of 30 total cases revealed that patients who were homozygous for the most common c.125C > T variant presented in the first decade of life with limb-girdle weakness as the initial symptom. Sensorineural hearing loss was associated with the c.456A > C variant. Leukocyte acid ceramidase activity varied from 4.1%-13.1% of controls. Ceramide species in fibroblasts were detected and total cellular ceramide content was elevated by 2 to 9-fold compared to controls. Treatment with rhAC normalized ceramide profiles in cultured fibroblasts to control levels within 48 h.
This study details the genotype-phenotype correlations observed in SMA-PME and shows the impact of rhAC to correct the abnormal cellular ceramide profile in cells.

Usefulness of phase gradients of otoacoustic emissions in auditory health screening: An exploration with swept tones.
Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are low-level sounds generated by the cochlea and widely used as a noninvasive tool to inspect cochlear impairments. However, only the amplitude information of OAE signals is used in current clinical tests, while the OAE phase containing important information about cochlear functions is commonly discarded, due to the insufficient frequency-resolution of existing OAE tests. In this study, swept tones with time-varying frequencies were used to measure stimulus frequency OAEs (SFOAEs) in human subjects, so that high-resolution phase spectra that are not available in existing OAE tests could be obtained and analyzed. The results showed that the phase of swept-tone SFOAEs demonstrated steep gradients as the frequency increased in human subjects with normal hearing. The steep phase gradients were sensitive to auditory functional abnormality caused by cochlear damage and stimulus artifacts introduced by system distortions. At low stimulus levels, the group delays derived from the phase gradients decreased from around 8.5 to 3 ms as the frequency increased from 1 to 10 kHz for subjects with normal hearing, and the pattern of group-delay versus frequency function showed significant difference for subjects with hearing loss. By using the swept-tone technology, the study suggests that the OAE phase gradients could provide highly sensitive information about the cochlear functions and therefore should be integrated into the conventional methods to improve the reliability of auditory health screening.

Implications of Seizure-Cluster Treatment on Healthcare Utilization: Use of Approved Rescue Medications.
People with epilepsy may experience seizure clusters despite a stable regimen of antiseizure medications. Such clusters have the potential to last ≥24 hours, typically occur in the community setting, and may progress to medical emergencies, such as status epilepticus, if untreated. Thus, long-acting rescue therapy for seizure clusters is needed that can be administered by nonmedical individuals outside a hospital. Benzodiazepines are the foundation of rescue therapy for seizure clusters. The approved outpatient treatments (ie, diazepam, midazolam) have differing profiles that may affect multiple aspects of health-care utilization. The current labeling of these medications allows for a second dose if needed to control the cluster. Although no head-to-head studies directly comparing rescue treatments have been conducted, differences between studies with generally similar designs may provide context for the potential importance of second doses of rescue therapy on health-care utilization.
For this analysis, large, long-term, open-label studies of approved seizure-cluster treatments designed for use by nonmedical caregivers were reviewed, and the percentage of seizure clusters for which a second dose was used or that were not controlled at 6, 12, and 24 hours was examined. Available data on hospitalizations were also collected.
The 3 identified studies meeting the inclusion criteria were for use of diazepam rectal gel, intranasal midazolam, and diazepam nasal spray. Across these studies, the use of a second dose ranged from <40% at 6 hours to <13% at 24 hours. Hospitalizations and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported variably across these studies.
These results demonstrate the importance of second doses of rescue therapy for seizure clusters for optimizing health-care utilization. Need for second doses should be included as one component. In turn, when second doses are needed, they have the potential to curtail emergency department use and hospitalization and to prevent further seizure clusters.

Systemic infection drives urgent care needs and outcome in adults with long-term neurological conditions.
It is estimated that 1 in 6 people are living with a long-term neurological condition (LTNC). Although it is likely that systemic infections are a common trigger for urgent tertiary care needs in LTNCs, there is a lack of data. Yet this is important since systemic infections are a modifiable risk factor, and hence the motivation for a formal evaluation. We undertook case note review of 155 consecutive unselected adult patients with LTNC receiving urgent care at a tertiary hospital between November and December 2019. Data were collected on presenting symptoms, diagnosis, length of stay, complications, and change in social needs. The most common LTNCs were neurocognitive disorders (n = 68, 44%), cerebrovascular disorders (n = 65, 42%), and epilepsy (n = 19, 12%). Respiratory infections were most common (n = 40, 62.5%), followed by urinary (n = 16, 25%), skin (n = 4, 6%), gastrointestinal (n = 3, 5%) and bone (n = 1, 1.5%). Systemic infection was the trigger for urgent care in 41.3% of patients and in multivariable regression was associated with an increased likelihood of admission (p < 10

, OR = 7.8, Nagelkerke R
2
 = 0.37), longer length of stay (p = 0.03, β = 5.91, R

 = 0.06), and death (p = 0.045, OR = 4.3, Nagelkerke R
2
 = 0.22). Altered mental status was the presenting symptom most frequently associated with infection (p < 10

, χ

 test). In conclusion, systemic infections are a major trigger of acute tertiary care needs in adults with LTNCs, and play a role in determining clinical outcome. Since systemic infections are preventable or can be treated if identified early, they may represent a modifiable target to improve quality of life, clinical outcomes and health service efficiency.

Intravenous ganaxolone in pediatric super-refractory status epilepticus: A single hospital experience.
Synaptic GABA
A
 receptor (GABA
A
R) internalization contributes to the drug resistant nature of super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). Ganaxolone is a 3β-methylated synthetic analog of the endogenous neuroactive steroid, allopregnanolone, that has positive allosteric modulatory activity on synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA
A
 receptors. Ganaxolone is currently in clinical trials to treat rare pediatric seizure disorders and established and refractory SE. Two pediatric patients with SRSE (age 17 and age 7) were treated under emergency investigational new drug (E-IND) applications with intravenous (IV) ganaxolone administered as an initial bolus and a maintenance infusion for up to 4.5 days with intermittent IV boluses as-needed followed by taper on day 5 and transitioned to chronic treatment using ganaxolone suspension. Adjunctive ganaxolone was effective in terminating SRSE in both patients, safely permitting IV anesthetics to be weaned. Seizure control has been maintained after transitioning to enteric ganaxolone. Further investigation of ganaxolone as a safe and effective treatment for SRSE is warranted.

Periodic electroencephalographic discharges and epileptic spasms involve cortico-striatal-thalamic loops on Arterial Spin Labeling Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
Periodic discharges are a rare peculiar electroencephalogram pattern, occasionally associated with motor or other clinical manifestations, usually observed in critically ill patients. Their underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Epileptic spasms in clusters and periodic discharges with motor manifestations share similar electroencephalogram pattern and some aetiologies of unfavourable prognosis such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or herpes encephalitis. Arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging identifies localizing ictal and inter-ictal changes in neurovascular coupling, therefore assumed able to reveal concerned cerebral structures. Here, we retrospectively analysed ictal and inter-ictal arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging in patients aged 6 months to 15 years (median 3 years 4 months) with periodic discharges including epileptic spasms, and compared these findings with those of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who never presented periodic discharges nor epileptic spasms as well as to those of age-matched healthy controls. Ictal electroencephalogram was recorded either simultaneously with arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging or during the close time lapse of patients' periodic discharges, whereas inter-ictal examinations were performed during the patients' active epilepsy but without seizures during the arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging. Ictal arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in five patients with periodic discharges [subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (1), stroke-like events (3), West syndrome with cortical malformation (1), two of them also had inter-ictal arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging]. Inter-ictal group included patients with drug-resistant epileptic spasms of various aetiologies (14) and structural drug-resistant focal epilepsy (8). Cortex, striatum and thalamus were segmented and divided in six functional subregions: prefrontal, motor (rostral, caudal), parietal, occipital and temporal. Rest cerebral blood flow values, absolute and relative to whole brain, were compared with those of age-matched controls for each subregion. Main findings were diffuse striatal as well as cortical motor cerebral blood flow increase during ictal examinations in generalized periodic discharges with motor manifestations (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis) and focal cerebral blood flow increase in corresponding cortical-striatal-thalamic subdivisions in lateralized periodic discharges with or without motor manifestations (stroke-like events and asymmetrical epileptic spasms) with straight topographical correlation with the electroencephalogram focus. For inter-ictal examinations, patients with epileptic spasms disclosed cerebral blood flow changes in corresponding cortical-striatal-thalamic subdivisions (absolute-cerebral blood flow decrease and relative-cerebral blood flow increase), more frequently when compared with the group of drug-resistant focal epilepsies, and not related to Vigabatrin treatment. Our results suggest that corresponding cortical-striatal-thalamic circuits are involved in periodic discharges with and without motor manifestations, including epileptic spasms, opening new insights in their pathophysiology and new therapeutical perspectives. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the generation of periodic discharges and of epileptic spasms combining existing pathophysiological models of cortical-striatal-thalamic network dynamics.

Treatment of CLN1 disease with a blood-brain barrier penetrating lysosomal enzyme.
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 1(CLN1 disease) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by genetic defects of palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1(
PPT1
), leading to accumulation of lipofuscin granules in brain and progressive neurodegeneration. Psychomotor regression, seizures, loss of vision, and movement disorder begin in infancy and result in early death. Currently, no disease-modifying therapy is available. We report a 68-month-old boy with CLN1 treated on a compassionate use basis weekly for 26 months with a PPT1 enzyme fused to an anti-insulin receptor antibody (AGT-194), thereby enabling penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During treatment, no side effects were observed, while seizure frequency decreased, life quality improved, and the boy's general condition remained stable. This case documents for the first time that treatment of CLN1 is principally feasible by an intravenous BBB penetrating enzyme replacement therapy using PPT1 fused with the human insulin receptor. Monitoring of side effects raised no unacceptable or unexpected safety concerns.Observed improvement of life quality related to ameliorated epilepsy control raises hope that further robust clinical trials including patients in earlier stages of disease will show positive results.

Genetic Testing for Malformations of Cortical Development: A Clinical Diagnostic Study.
Malformations of cortical development (MCD), though individually rare, constitute a significant burden of disease. The diagnostic yield of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in these patients varies across studies and methods, and novel genes and variants continue to emerge.
Patients (n = 123) with a definite radiologic or histopathologic diagnosis of MCD, with or without epilepsy were included in this study. They underwent NGS-based targeted gene panel (TGP) testing, whole-exome sequencing (WES), or WES-based virtual panel testing. Selected patients who underwent epilepsy surgery (n = 69) also had somatic gene testing of brain tissue-derived DNA. We analyzed predictors of positive germline genetic finding and diagnostic yield of respective methods.
Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline genetic variants were detected in 21% of patients (26/123). In the surgical subgroup (69/123), we performed somatic sequencing in 40% of cases (28/69) and detected causal variants in 18% (5/28). Diagnostic yield did not differ between TGP, WES-based virtual gene panel, and open WES (
p
 = 0.69). Diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia type 2A, epilepsy, and intellectual disability were associated with positive results of germline testing. We report previously unpublished variants in 16/26 patients and 4 cases of MCD with likely pathogenic variants in non-MCD genes.
In this study, we are reporting genetic findings of a large cohort of MCD patients with epilepsy or potentially epileptogenic MCD. We determine predictors of successful ascertainment of a genetic diagnosis in real-life setting and report novel, likely pathogenic variants in MCD and non-MCD genes alike.

Imbalance between the function of Na
Altered expression patterns of Na
+
-K
+
-2Cl
-
 (NKCC1) and K
+
-Cl
-
 (KCC2) co-transporters have been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Here, we assessed the effects of imbalanced NKCC1 and KCC2 on γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurotransmission in certain brain regions involved in human focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).
We sought to map a micro-macro neuronal network to better understand the epileptogenesis mechanism. In patients with FCD, we resected cortical tissue from the seizure the onset zone (SOZ) and the non-seizure onset zone (non-SOZ) inside the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Additionally, we resected non-epileptic neocortical tissue from the patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) as control. All of tissues were analyzed using perforated patch recordings. NKCC1 and KCC2 co-transporters expression and distribution were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.
Results revealed that depolarized GABAergic signals were observed in pyramidal neurons in the SOZ and non-SOZ groups compared with the control group. The total number of pyramidal neurons showing GABAergic spontaneous postsynaptic currents was 11/14, 7/17, and 0/12 in the SOZ, non-SOZ, and control groups, respectively. The depolarizing GABAergic response was significantly dampened by the specific NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (BUM). Patients with FCD exhibited higher expression and internalized distribution of KCC2, particularly in the SOZ group.
Our results provide evidence of a potential neurocircuit underpinning SOZ epileptogenesis and non-SOZ seizure susceptibility. Imbalanced function of NKCC1 and KCC2 may affect chloride ion homeostasis in neurons and alter GABAergic inhibitory action, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis in FCDs. Maintaining chloride ion homeostasis in the neurons may represent a new avenue for the development of novel anti-seizure medications (ASMs).

White Matter Microstructure is Associated with Serum Neuroactive Steroids and Psychological Functioning.
Military service members are at increased risk for mental health issues and comorbidity with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common. Largely overlapping symptoms between conditions suggest a shared pathophysiology. The present work investigates the associations between white matter microstructure, psychological functioning, and serum neuroactive steroids that are part of the stress-response system.
Diffusion-weighted brain imaging was acquired from 163 participants (with and without military affiliation) and free-water-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) was extracted. Associations between serum neurosteroid levels of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and pregnenolone (PREGNE), psychological functioning, and whole-brain white matter microstructure were assessed using regression models. Moderation models tested the effect of mTBI and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mTBI on these associations.
ALLO is associated with whole-brain white matter FAT (β=.24, t=3.00, p= .006). This association is significantly modulated by PTSD+mTBI comorbidity (β=.01, t=3.07, p=.003) while an mTBI diagnosis alone did not significantly impact this association (p=.183). There was no significant association between PREGNE and FAT (p=.380). Importantly, lower FAT is associated with poor psychological functioning (β=-.19, t=-2.35, p=.020).
This study provides novel insight into a potential common pathophysiological mechanism of neurosteroid dysregulation underlying the high risk for mental health issues in military service members. Further, comorbidity of PTSD and mTBI may bring the compensatory effects of the brain's stress response to their limit. Future research is needed to investigate whether neurosteroid regulation may be a promising tool for restoring brain health and improving psychological functioning.

Recurrent headache and visual symptoms in a young man: a rare neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease case report.
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Patients with NIID may present with heterogeneous clinical symptoms, including episodic encephalopathy, dementia, limb weakness, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. Among the NIID cases reported in China, patients often have complicated and severe manifestations. Therefore, many clinicians do not consider the disease when the patient presents with relatively minor complaints.
We present the case of a 39-year-old man showing migraine-aura-like symptoms for the past 3 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintense signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum and corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) over time. In addition, brain atrophy that was not concomitant with the patient's age was detected while retrospectively reviewing the patient's imaging results. Genetic analysis and skin biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of NIID. The patient was treated with sibelium, and the symptoms did not recur.
Migraine-aura-like symptoms may be the predominant clinical presentation in young patients with NIID. Persistent high-intensity signals on DWI in the brain and early-onset brain atrophy might be clues for the diagnosis of NIID.

Intracranial cysts: incidental or neurodevelopmental?
Intracranial cysts are fluid-filled sacs within the brain. There is a diversity of intracranial cysts with different incidences in addition to the growing awareness about comorbidities and the consequences. The present study aimed to evaluate cystic findings in children who were admitted to the department of pediatric neurology.
Children who were admitted to the Clinic of Pediatric Neurology and who had an MRI between 2016 and 2021 were evaluated. The MRI examination was performed with the pediatric epilepsy protocol. Children with primary intracranial cysts were enrolled in the study. Demographic and clinical findings were evaluated from the hospital's database and patients' files.
Among the 78 patients, 36 (46.2%) were male and 42 (53.8%) were female. The mean age was 7 ± 5.4 years. The most frequent presenting complaint was a seizure (47.4%). Approximately one-quarter (28.2%) had mental and/or motor retardation. Nine (11.5%) of the children had a neuropsychiatric diagnosis. Most of the cysts were located at the midline (41%) with the majority located extra-axial (71.8%) and supratentorial (78.2%). Arachnoid cysts were observed most frequently with a percentage of 64.1%, followed by pineal cysts (15.4%). The history of seizure, epilepsy, presence of mental retardation, and neuropsychiatric problems were evaluated according to the population ratios based on z approximation in which significantly higher rates were observed among cases with intracranial cysts.
Intracranial cysts should be taken into consideration for comorbid pathologies, especially in the childhood period. Early evaluation in patients with intracranial cysts for developmental delay and neuropsychiatric problems is important.

[Expression of cation chloride cotransporter (NKCC1/KCC2) in brain tissue of children with focal cortical dysplasia type Ⅱ].
Objective:
 To investigate the expression of cation chloride cotransporter (NKCC1/KCC2) in the neurons from cerebral lesions of children with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type Ⅱ, to provide a morphological basis for revealing the possible mechanism of epilepsy. 
Methods:
 Eight cases of FCD type Ⅱ diagnosed at Beijing Haidian Hospital, Beijing, China and 12 cases diagnosed at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China from February 2017 to December 2019 were included. The expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 in FCD type Ⅱa and FCD type Ⅱb was detected using immunohistochemistry and double immunohistochemical stains. The average optical density of NKCC1 in dysmorphic neurons and normal neurons was also determined using immunohistochemical staining in FCD type Ⅱa (10 cases). 
Results:
 The patients were all younger than 14 years of age. Ten cases were classified as FCD type IIa, and 10 cases as FCD type Ⅱb. NKCC1 was expressed in the cytoplasm of normal cerebral cortex neurons and KCC2 expressed on cell membranes. In dysmorphic neurons of FCD type Ⅱa, expression of NKCC1 increased, which was statistically higher than that of normal neurons (
P<
0.01). Aberrant expression of KCC2 in dysmorphic neurons was also noted in the cytoplasm. In the FCD Ⅱb type, the expression pattern of NKCC1/KCC2 in dysmorphic neurons was the same as that of FCD type Ⅱa. The aberrant expression of NKCC1 in balloon cells was negative or weakly positive on the cell membrane, while the aberrant expression of KCC2 was absent. 
Conclusions:
 The expression pattern of NKCC1/KCC2 in dysmorphic neurons and balloon cells is completely different from that of normal neurons. The NKCC1/KCC2 protein-expression changes may affect the transmembrane chloride flow of neurons, modify the effect of inhibitory neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid and increase neuronal excitability. These effects may be related to the occurrence of clinical epileptic symptoms.

Complications of Influenza A or B Virus Infection in Individuals With 
To determine the frequency and spectrum of complications of influenza infection in individuals with 
SCN1A
 positive Dravet syndrome (
SCN1A
-DS).
Individuals with 
SCN1A
-DS were identified in neurologists' care at two hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, with additional searches of EEG databases, the Victorian PAEDS FluCan influenza database, and the University of Melbourne Epilepsy Genetics Research Program database. Medical records were searched and families questioned to identify individuals who had had an influenza infection; reported infections were confirmed by pathology report. For these individuals, we obtained baseline clinical characteristics, and clinical details of the influenza infection.
21/82 individuals (26%) had 24 documented influenza infections (17 influenza A, 7 influenza B) at age 0.5-25 years (median 4 years). All presented to hospital, 18/24 (75%) for status epilepticus or seizure exacerbations. Recovery was prompt in 18/24 (75%) infections, delayed but complete in 1/24 (4%) and incomplete in 5/24 (21%). One child died from influenza pneumonia, and long-term neurologic sequelae were seen with four infections. These individuals were poorly responsive following termination of status epilepticus; brain imaging in two showed cerebral oedema, one also having imaging features of laminar necrosis. All have ongoing neurologic deficits compared with their baseline, one having profound global impairment.

Prenatal Carbamazepine Exposure and Academic Performance in Adolescents: A Population-Based Cohort Study.
To investigate whether children born to mothers who used carbamazepine during pregnancy had worse academic performance in adolescence.
This population-based cohort study included all live-born singletons in Denmark between 1996 and 2002 who participated in the national 9
th
 grade exit examination (n=370,859). Those born to mothers with prescription of antiseizure medications other than carbamazepine during pregnancy were excluded. We examined the association of 
in utero
 exposure to maternal carbamazepine redeemed during pregnancy (n=290) with academic performance of offspring, defined by the scores in Danish and mathematics in 9
th
 grade exit examination. We estimated mean z-score difference with linear regression adjusted for socioeconomic factors and potential indications, including epilepsy and medication for other psychiatric disorders. Additional analyses addressing confounding by indication included comparison between 
in utero
 exposed versus past exposed, and between past exposed and never exposed. 
In utero
 exposure to valproate monotherapy was used as a positive control, and 
in utero
 exposure to lamotrigine as a negative control.
At the age of 16.1 (standard deviation, 0.4) years, adolescents 
in utero
 exposed to maternal carbamazepine monotherapy had lower scores both in Danish and mathematics in 9
th
 grade exit examination (adjusted z-score difference, -0.14 [95% CI, -0.24 to -0.05] and -0.17 [95% CI, -0.28 to -0.07], respectively). 
In utero
 exposure to carbamazepine monotherapy were associated with lower scores than past exposure only (adjusted z-score difference, -0.24 [95% CI, -0.41 to -0.06] for Danish, and -0.25 [95% CI, -0.44 to -0.06] for mathematics), while past exposure to carbamazepine was associated with minor decrease in offspring's academic performance (adjusted z-score difference, -0.02 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.06] for Danish, and -0.07 [95% CI, -0.16 to 0.01] for mathematics). The association was also observed for 
in utero
 exposure to valproate monotherapy, but not for 
in utero
 exposure to lamotrigine.
In utero
 exposure to carbamazepine was associated with poorer academic performance in adolescence, as represented by lower scores in 9
th
 grade exit examination in Danish and mathematics. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings due to limitations in the present study and variable findings in prior studies.
This study provides Class III evidence that academic performance, as reflected in 9th grade exit examinations in Danish and mathematics, was worse among those exposed to carbamazepine monotherapy in utero, compared to those without in utero exposure to antiseizure medications.

Association Between Characteristics of National Association of Epilepsy Centers and Reported Utilization of Specific Surgical Techniques.
Nearly one third of persons with epilepsy will continue having seizures despite trialing multiple antiseizure medications. Epilepsy surgery may be beneficial in these cases, and evaluation at a comprehensive epilepsy center is recommended. Numerous palliative and potentially curative approaches exist, and types of surgery performed may be influenced by center characteristics. This article describes epilepsy center characteristics associated with epilepsy surgery access and volumes in the U.S.
We analyzed National Association of Epilepsy Centers 2019 annual report and supplemental survey data obtained with responses from 206 adult epilepsy center directors and 136 pediatric epilepsy center directors in the United States. Surgical treatment volumes were compiled with center characteristics, including U.S. Census region. We used multivariable modeling with zero-inflated Poisson regression models to present odds ratios and incidence rate ratios of receiving a given surgery type based on center characteristics.
The response rate was 100% with individual element missingness less than 4% across 352 observations undergoing univariate analysis. Multivariable models included 319 complete observations. Significant regional differences were present. Rates of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) were lower at centers in the Midwest (IRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.92; p = 0.006) and the Northeast (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.96; p = 0.022) compared to those in the South. Conversely, responsive neurostimulation (RNS) implantation rates were higher in the Midwest (IRR 1.45, 95% CI 1.1-1.91; p = 0.008) and West (IRR 1.91, 95% CI 1.49-2.44; p < 0.001) compared to the South. Center accreditation level, institution type, demographics, and resources were also associated with variations in access and rates of potentially curative and palliative surgical interventions.
Epilepsy surgery procedure volumes are influenced by U.S. epilepsy center region and other characteristics. These variations may impact access to specific surgical treatments for persons with drug resistant epilepsy across the U.S.

A model for the propagation of seizure activity in normal brain tissue.
Epilepsies are characterized by paroxysmal electrophysiological events and seizures, which can propagate across the brain. One of the main unsolved questions in epilepsy is how epileptic activity can invade normal tissue and thus propagate across the brain. To investigate this question, we consider three computational models at the neural network scale to study the underlying dynamics of seizure propagation, understand which specific features play a role, and relate them to clinical or experimental observations. We consider both the internal connectivity structure between neurons and the input properties in our characterization. We show that a paroxysmal input is sometimes controlled by the network while in other instances, it can lead the network activity to itself produce paroxysmal activity, and thus will further propagate to efferent networks. We further show how the details of the network architecture are essential to determine this switch to a seizure-like regime. We investigated the nature of the instability involved and in particular found a central role for the inhibitory connectivity. We propose a probabilistic approach to the propagative/non-propagative scenarios, which may serve as a guide to control the seizure by using appropriate stimuli.
Significance
Our computational study shows the specific role that the inhibitory population can have and the possible dynamics regarding the propagation of seizure-like behavior in three different neuronal networks. We find that both structural and dynamical aspects are important to determine whether seizure activity invades the network. We show the existence of a specific time window favorable to the reversal of the seizure propagation by appropriate stimuli.

Disruption of mTORC1 rescues neuronal overgrowth and synapse function dysregulated by Pten loss.
Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a negative regulator of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Mutations in PTEN are found in patients with autism, epilepsy, or macrocephaly. In mouse models, Pten loss results in neuronal hypertrophy, hyperexcitability, seizures, and ASD-like behaviors. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these phenotypes are not well delineated. We determined which of the Pten loss-driven aberrations in neuronal form and function are orchestrated by downstream mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 prevented increase in soma size, migration, spine density, and dendritic overgrowth in Pten knockout dentate gyrus granule neurons. Genetic knockout of Raptor to disrupt mTORC1 complex formation blocked Pten loss-mediated neuronal hypertrophy. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that genetic disruption of mTORC1 rescued Pten loss-mediated increase in excitatory synaptic transmission. We have identified an essential role for mTORC1 in orchestrating Pten loss-driven neuronal hypertrophy and synapse formation.

Inhibition of connexin hemichannels alleviates neuroinflammation and hyperexcitability in temporal lobe epilepsy.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common types of epilepsy, yet approximately one-third of patients are refractory to current anticonvulsive drugs, which target neurons and synapses. Astrocytic and microglial dysfunction is commonly found in epileptic foci and has been shown to contribute to neuroinflammation and hyperexcitability in chronic epilepsy. Accumulating evidence points to a key role for glial hemichannels in epilepsy, but inhibiting both connexin (Cx) gap junctions and hemichannels can lead to undesirable side effects because the former coordinate physiological functions of cell assemblies. It would be a great benefit to use an orally available small molecule to block hemichannels to alleviate epileptic symptoms. Here, we explored the effect of D4, a newly developed compound that inhibits the Cx hemichannels but not Cx gap junctions using the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE. In vitro application of D4 caused a near-complete reduction in the pilocarpine-induced cell membrane permeability associated with increased Cx hemichannel activity. Moreover, preadministration of D4 in vivo effectively reduced neuroinflammation and altered synaptic inhibition, which then enhanced the animal survival rate. Posttreatment with a single dose of D4 in vivo has prolonged effects on suppressing the activation of astrocytes and microglia and rescued the changes in neuroinflammatory and synaptic gene expression induced by pilocarpine. Collectively, these results indicate that targeting Cx hemichannels by D4 is an effective and promising strategy for treating epilepsy in which neuroinflammation plays a critical role.

IER3IP1 is critical for maintaining glucose homeostasis through regulating the endoplasmic reticulum function and survival of β cells.
Recessive mutations in IER3IP1 (immediate early response 3 interacting protein 1) cause a syndrome of microcephaly, epilepsy, and permanent neonatal diabetes (MEDS). IER3IP1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, which is crucial for brain development; however, the role of IER3IP1 in β cells remains unknown. We have generated two mouse models with either constitutive or inducible IER3IP1 deletion in β cells, named IER3IP1-βKO and IER3IP1-iβKO, respectively. We found that IER3IP1-βKO causes severe early-onset, insulin-deficient diabetes. Functional studies revealed a markedly dilated β-cell ER along with increased proinsulin misfolding and elevated expression of the ER chaperones, including PDI, ERO1, BiP, and P58IPK. Islet transcriptome analysis confirmed by qRT-PCR revealed decreased expression of genes associated with β-cell maturation, cell cycle, and antiapoptotic genes, accompanied by increased expression of antiproliferation genes. Indeed, multiple independent approaches further demonstrated that IER3IP1-βKO impaired β-cell maturation and proliferation, along with increased condensation of β-cell nuclear chromatin. Inducible β-cell IER3IP1 deletion in adult (8-wk-old) mice induced a similar diabetic phenotype, suggesting that IER3IP1 is also critical for function and survival even after β-cell early development. Importantly, IER3IP1 was decreased in β cells of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), suggesting an association of IER3IP1 deficiency with β-cell dysfunction in the more-common form of diabetes. These data not only uncover a critical role of IER3IP1 in β cells but also provide insight into molecular basis of diabetes caused by IER3IP1 mutations.

Evaluation of a Rapid Topiramate Titration Scheme for the Early Detection of Cognitive Side Effects.
Topiramate (TPM) is effective for treating epilepsy, but executive dysfunction is a common side effect that could significantly affect everyday life. Additionally, previous studies have suggested that patients might be unaware of these changes.
To evaluate a rapid TPM titration scheme for the early detection of adverse cognitive side effects.
In this retrospective study, we assessed changes in objective cognitive performance (EpiTrack
®
) after rapidly titrating TPM (50 mg per day during an inpatient stay) in 49 epilepsy patients and compared those results with an outpatient control group that underwent the recommended standard titration (n = 23 with 25-50 mg per week).
Using Bayesian statistics, analyses revealed decisive evidence of a negative effect on cognitive performance when TPM was introduced (BF 31480000000) independent of the titration speed (BF 0.739). When using a fast titration rate, deficits in executive function increased from a baseline of 53.1 to 73.5% at follow-up, and 55.1% experienced a statistically significant intraindividual decline. When using the standard titration scheme, impairments increased from 52.2 to 65.2%, with an intraindividual deterioration found in 52.2% of the patients.
Physicians might be able to detect adverse cognitive side effects sooner in epilepsy patients if TPM is administered using a faster titration rate while applying repeated cognitive assessments within days. This approach might help prevent any unnoticed intolerance and eventual negative consequences for the patient. Therefore, we recommend monitoring early on for adverse changes instead of withholding a potentially effective treatment option because of anticipated side effects.

Glial Glutamine Homeostasis in Health and Disease.
Glutamine is an essential cerebral metabolite. Several critical brain processes are directly linked to glutamine, including ammonia homeostasis, energy metabolism and neurotransmitter recycling. Astrocytes synthesize and release large quantities of glutamine, which is taken up by neurons to replenish the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter pools. Astrocyte glutamine hereby sustains the glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle, synaptic transmission and general brain function. Cerebral glutamine homeostasis is linked to the metabolic coupling of neurons and astrocytes, and relies on multiple cellular processes, including TCA cycle function, synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter uptake. Dysregulations of processes related to glutamine homeostasis are associated with several neurological diseases and may mediate excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. In particular, diminished astrocyte glutamine synthesis is a common neuropathological component, depriving neurons of an essential metabolic substrate and precursor for neurotransmitter synthesis, hereby leading to synaptic dysfunction. While astrocyte glutamine synthesis is quantitatively dominant in the brain, oligodendrocyte-derived glutamine may serve important functions in white matter structures. In this review, the crucial roles of glial glutamine homeostasis in the healthy and diseased brain are discussed. First, we provide an overview of cellular recycling, transport, synthesis and metabolism of glutamine in the brain. These cellular aspects are subsequently discussed in relation to pathological glutamine homeostasis of hepatic encephalopathy, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Further studies on the multifaceted roles of cerebral glutamine will not only increase our understanding of the metabolic collaboration between brain cells, but may also aid to reveal much needed therapeutic targets of several neurological pathologies.

Bayesian inference for fitting cardiac models to experiments: estimating parameter distributions using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and approximate Bayesian computation.
Customization of cardiac action potential models has become increasingly important with the recognition of patient-specific models and virtual patient cohorts as valuable predictive tools. Nevertheless, developing customized models by fitting parameters to data poses technical and methodological challenges: despite noise and variability associated with real-world datasets, traditional optimization methods produce a single "best-fit" set of parameter values. Bayesian estimation methods seek distributions of parameter values given the data by obtaining samples from the target distribution, but in practice widely known Bayesian algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo tend to be computationally inefficient and scale poorly with the dimensionality of parameter space. In this paper, we consider two computationally efficient Bayesian approaches: the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm and the approximate Bayesian computation sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) algorithm. We find that both methods successfully identify distributions of model parameters for two cardiac action potential models using model-derived synthetic data and an experimental dataset from a zebrafish heart. Although both methods appear to converge to the same distribution family and are computationally efficient, HMC generally finds narrower marginal distributions, while ABC-SMC is less sensitive to the algorithmic settings including the prior distribution.

Delineation of a KDM2B-related neurodevelopmental disorder and its associated DNA methylation signature.
Pathogenic variants in genes involved in the epigenetic machinery are an emerging cause of neurodevelopment disorders (NDDs). Lysine-demethylase 2B (KDM2B) encodes an epigenetic regulator and mouse models suggest an important role during development. We set out to determine whether KDM2B variants are associated with NDD.
Through international collaborations, we collected data on individuals with heterozygous KDM2B variants. We applied methylation arrays on peripheral blood DNA samples to determine a KDM2B associated epigenetic signature.
We recruited a total of 27 individuals with heterozygous variants in KDM2B. We present evidence, including a shared epigenetic signature, to support a pathogenic classification of 15 KDM2B variants and identify the CxxC domain as a mutational hotspot. Both loss-of-function and CxxC-domain missense variants present with a specific subepisignature. Moreover, the KDM2B episignature was identified in the context of a dual molecular diagnosis in multiple individuals. Our efforts resulted in a cohort of 21 individuals with heterozygous (likely) pathogenic variants. Individuals in this cohort present with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; autism; attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; congenital organ anomalies mainly of the heart, eyes, and urogenital system; and subtle facial dysmorphism.
Pathogenic heterozygous variants in KDM2B are associated with NDD and a specific epigenetic signature detectable in peripheral blood.

Biallelic variants in PIGN cause Fryns syndrome, multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome, and neurologic phenotypes: A genotype-phenotype correlation study.
Biallelic PIGN variants have been described in Fryns syndrome, multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizure syndrome (MCAHS), and neurologic phenotypes. The full spectrum of clinical manifestations in relation to the genotypes is yet to be reported.
Genotype and phenotype data were collated and analyzed for 61 biallelic PIGN cases: 21 new and 40 previously published cases. Functional analysis was performed for 2 recurrent variants (c.2679C>G p.Ser893Arg and c.932T>G p.Leu311Trp).
Biallelic-truncating variants were detected in 16 patients-10 with Fryns syndrome, 1 with MCAHS1, 2 with Fryns syndrome/MCAHS1, and 3 with neurologic phenotype. There was an increased risk of prenatal or neonatal death within this group (6 deaths were in utero or within 2 months of life; 6 pregnancies were terminated). Incidence of polyhydramnios, congenital anomalies (eg, diaphragmatic hernia), and dysmorphism was significantly increased. Biallelic missense or mixed genotype were reported in the remaining 45 cases-32 showed a neurologic phenotype and 12 had MCAHS1. No cases of diaphragmatic hernia or abdominal wall defects were seen in this group except patient 1 in which we found the missense variant p.Ser893Arg to result in functionally null alleles, suggesting the possibility of an undescribed functionally important region in the final exon. For all genotypes, there was complete penetrance for developmental delay and near-complete penetrance for seizures and hypotonia in patients surviving the neonatal period.
We have expanded the described spectrum of phenotypes and natural history associated with biallelic PIGN variants. Our study shows that biallelic-truncating variants usually result in the more severe Fryns syndrome phenotype, but neurologic problems, such as developmental delay, seizures, and hypotonia, present across all genotypes. Functional analysis should be considered when the genotypes do not correlate with the predicted phenotype because there may be other functionally important regions in PIGN that are yet to be discovered.

Laser hyperthermia: Past, present, and future.
Magnetic resonance imaging-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is an ablative procedure using heat from a laser to provide cytoreduction in tissue. It is a minimally invasive procedure that has been used in intracranial pathologies such as high-grade gliomas, metastatic lesions, epilepsy, and other lesions. While LITT may offer a more acceptable complication profile compared to open surgery, the role of laser therapy for intracranial lesions in current treatment paradigms continues to evolve. This review will focus on the background and application of LITT, the current evidence for its use, and future directions for the technology.

In vitro effects of S-Licarbazepine as a potential precision therapy on SCN8A variants causing neuropsychiatric disorders.
Variants in SCN8A, the coding gene for Na
V
 1.6 channels, are characterized by a variety of symptoms including, intractable epileptic seizures, psychomotor delay, progressive cognitive decline, autistic features, ataxia or dystonia. Standard anticonvulsant treatment has only a limited impact on the course of disease.
We investigated the therapeutic potential of S-Licarbazepine, an enhancer of slow inactivation of voltage gated sodium channels, on two variants with biophysical and neuronal gain-of-function (G1475R, M1760I) and one variant with biophysical gain-of-function but neuronal loss-of-function (A1622D) in neuroblastoma cells and in murine primary hippocampal neuron cultures. These three variants cover the broad spectrum of Na
V
 1.6-associated disease and are linked to representative phenotypes of mild to moderate epilepsy (G1475R), developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (M1760I) and intellectual disability without epilepsy (A1622D).
Similar to known effects on Na
V
 1.6 wildtype channels, S-Licarbazepine predominantly enhances slow inactivation on all tested variants, irrespective of their particular biophysical mechanisms. However, beyond that, S-Licarbazepine exhibits variant-specific effects including a partial reversal of pathologically slowed fast inactivation dynamics (A1622D, M1760I) and a trend to reduce enhanced persistent Na
+
 current by A1622D variant channels. Furthermore, our data in primary transfected neurons reveal that not only variant-associated hyperexcitability (M1760I and G1475R) but also hypoexcitability (A1622D) can be modulated by S-Lic.
S-Licarbazepine not only owns substance- but also variant-specific effects. Personalized treatment regimens optimized to achieve such variant-specific pharmacological modulation may help to reduce adverse side effects and improve the overall therapeutic outcome of SCN8A-related disease.

Heterozygous Mutation of Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Alpha Subunit 2 and Pumilio Homolog 1 Genes in a Pediatric Patient: A Case Report.
Epilepsy is a neurological condition brought on by recurrent and spontaneous seizures in patients with hypersynchronous neuronal ensemble activity. These spontaneous seizures appear to be brought on by increased neuronal excitability and synaptic synchronization. The development of neuronal hyperexcitability and acquiring epilepsy is still poorly understood. Cell differentiation and development might be related to the pumilio RNA-binding family member 1 (Pumilio 1 (
PUM1
)). Complete deficiency of this gene causes misregulation of the proteins involved in the control of neuronal excitability. Furthermore, the voltage-gated sodium channels alpha subunit 2 (
SCN2A
) triggers action potentials in brain neurons, and a variety of severe hereditary epilepsy syndromes are caused by their mutation. Here, we present a rare case of a seven-year-old female with co-occurrence of two genetic mutations in the pumilio homolog 1 (
PUM1
) and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 2 (
SCN2A
).

Interictal and postictal 
To evaluate the performance of 
18
F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography ( 
18
F-FDG PET/CT) in localizing epileptogenic zones, comparing 
18
F-FDG injection performed in the traditional interictal period with that performed near the time of a seizure.
We evaluated patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent 
18
F-FDG PET/CT. The reference standards for localization of the epileptogenic zone were histopathology and follow-up examinations (in patients who underwent surgery) or serial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, long-term video EEG, and magnetic resonance imaging (in patients who did not). The 
18
F-FDG injection was performed whether the patient had an epileptic seizure during the EEG monitoring period or not. The 
18
F-FDG PET/CT results were categorized as concordant or discordant with the reference standards.
Of the 110 patients evaluated, 10 were in a postictal group (FDG injection after a seizure) and 100 were in the interictal group. The 
18
F-FDG PET/CT was concordant with the reference standards in nine (90%) of the postictal group patients and in 60 (60%) of the interictal group patients. Among the nine postictal group patients in whom the results were concordant, the 
18
F-FDG PET/CT showed hypermetabolism and hypometabolism in the epileptogenic zone in four (44.4%) and five (55.6%), respectively.
Our data indicate that 
18
F-FDG PET/CT is a helpful tool for localization of the epileptogenic zone and that EEG monitoring is an important means of correlating the findings. In addition, postictal 
18
F-FDG PET/CT is able to identify the epileptogenic zone by showing either hypometabolism or hypermetabolism.

Cerebral Paragonimiasis Presenting with Dementia.
We report a case of an 80-year-old Korean man with chronic cerebral paragonimiasis who presented with progressive memory impairment. He suffered from pulmonary paragonimiasis 60 years ago and has been experiencing epilepsy since the age of 45. He began experiencing memory and cognitive deterioration 3 years ago. He visited the neuropsychiatric department of our hospital to check his symptoms and health from a year ago. Contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging study revealed calcifications and cystic lesions encompassing the right temporo-occipital region. Encephalomalatic changes were also observed in the right occipital and temporal areas. The anti-Paragonimus specific IgG antibodies in his serum showed a strong positive response. The neuropsychological test results showed a Global Deterioration Scale of 4 and a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale of 1. The chronic cerebral paragonimiasis lesions in the patient's right temporo-occipital region might induce the dementic change.

VGSC-DB: an online database of voltage-gated sodium channels.
As an important member of ion channels family, the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC/Na
v
) is associated with a variety of diseases, including epilepsy, migraine, ataxia, etc., and has always been a hot target for drug design and discovery. Many subtype-selective modulators targeting VGSCs have been reported, and some of them have been approved for clinical applications. However, the drug design resources related to VGSCs are insufficient, especially the lack of accurate and extensive compound data toward VGSCs. To fulfill this demand, we develop the Voltage-gated Sodium Channels Database (VGSC-DB). VGSC-DB is the first open-source database for VGSCs, which provides open access to 6055 data records, including 3396 compounds from 173 references toward nine subtypes of Na
v
s (Na
v
1.1 ~ Na
v
1.9). A total of 28 items of information is included in each data record, including the chemical structure, biological activity (IC
50
/EC
50
), target, binding site, organism, chemical and physical properties, etc. VGSC-DB collects the data from small-molecule compounds, toxins and various derivatives. Users can search the information of compounds by text or structure, and the advanced search function is also supported to realize batch query. VGSC-DB is freely accessible at http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/vgsc/ , and all the data can be downloaded in XLSX/SDF file formats.

Magnitude of common mental disorders and associated factors among patients with Epilepsy in Amhara regional state, Northwest Ethiopia.
Common mental disorders are severe and frequent co-morbid psychiatric illnesses with epilepsy. Different study findings across the world showed that patients with epilepsy have a higher burden of mental disorders than the general population. However, these issues in patients with epilepsy have been consistently undiagnosed.
The study aimed to screen common mental disorders and the determinants among patients with epilepsy attending at Fenote Selam hospital.
An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with Epilepsy from March 10 to May 15, 2019. Patients were assessed for the risk of common mental disorders using a pretested, structured, self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20). The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 software and analyzed using R version 4.0 software. Descriptive statistics were computed using frequency, percent, mean, and standard deviations. A simple logistic regression model was fit to identify the association and strength of exploratory variables and common mental disorders at a 95% confidence interval and p-value < 0.05.
The study included 202 patients diagnosed with epilepsy and yielded a response of 91.4%. About 53% of the patients were males. The magnitude of common mental disorders among patients with epilepsy was 57.9% (95% CI: 44.56, 71.24). Being more than one substance user (AOR = 5.7; 95%CI: 1.6, 20.7) and Not having social support (AOR = 4.3; 95%CI: 1.5, 11.9) were the identified determinants of common mental disorders.
The magnitude of common mental disorders among patients with epilepsy were high. Not having social support and khat chewing were the identified risk factors significantly associated with common mental disorders. Early screening and treatments are the key interventions to prevent complications and deaths from common mental disorders.

Amplitude synchronization of spontaneous activity of medial and lateral temporal gyri reveals altered thalamic connectivity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.
In this study, we examined whether amplitude synchronization of medial (MTL) and lateral (LTL) temporal lobes can detect unique alterations in patients with MTL epilepsy (mTLE) with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). This was a retrospective study of preoperative resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data from 31 patients with mTLE with MTS (age 23-69) and 16 controls (age 21-35). fMRI data were preprocessed based on a multistep preprocessing pipeline and registered to a standard space. Using each subject's T1-weighted scan, the MTL and LTL were automatically segmented, manually revised and then fit to a standard space using a symmetric normalization registration algorithm. Dual regression analysis was applied on preprocessed rsfMRI data to detect amplitude synchronization of medial and lateral temporal segments with the rest of the brain. We calculated the overlapped volume ratio of synchronized voxels within specific target regions including the thalamus (total and bilateral). A general linear model was used with Bonferroni correction for covariates of epilepsy duration and age of patient at scan to statistically compare synchronization in patients with mTLE with MTS and controls, as well as with respect to whether patients remained seizure-free (SF) or not (NSF) after receiving epilepsy surgery. We found increased ipsilateral positive connectivity between the LTLs and the thalamus and contralateral negative connectivity between the MTLs and the thalamus in patients with mTLE with MTS compared to controls. We also found increased asymmetry of functional connectivity between temporal lobe subregions and the thalamus in patients with mTLE with MTS, with increased positive connectivity between the LTL and the lesional-side thalamus as well as increased negative connectivity between the MTL and the nonlesional-side thalamus. This asymmetry was also seen in NSF patients but was not seen in SF patients and controls. Amplitude synchronization was an effective method to detect functional connectivity alterations in patients with mTLE with MTS. Patients with mTLE with MTS overall showed increased temporal-thalamic connectivity. There was increased functional involvement of the thalamus in MTS, underscoring its role in seizure spread. Increased functional thalamic asymmetry patterns in NSF patients may have a potential role in prognosticating patient response to surgery. Elucidating regions with altered functional connectivity to temporal regions can improve understanding of the involvement of different regions in the disease to potentially target for intervention or use for prognosis for surgery. Future studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of using patient-specific abnormalities in patterns to predict surgical outcome.

[Analysis of clinical and imaging features of 6 cases of linear scleroderma en coup de sabre with central nervous system involvement in children].
Objective:
 To summarize the clinical and imaging features of linear scleroderma en coup de saber (LSCS) with central nervous system involvement in children. 
Methods:
 The clinical data(clinical manifestations and imaging features) of 6 children diagnosed with LSCS with central nervous system involvement who were admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University from May 2019 to November 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. 
Results:
 The 6 patients were all female, aged 6.8 (3.3, 11.0) years at the time of diagnosis, and aged 3.0 (1.7, 4.1) years at the time of discovery of facial skin lesions. Facial skin lesions appeared before neurological symptoms in 5 cases, and neurological symptoms appeared 2 months before skin lesions in 1 case. All the patients had "sword wound" skin lesions on the forehead with alopecia. Neurological manifestations included epileptic seizures in 6 cases, focal neurological defects in 5 cases, and headaches in 2 cases. The intracranial lesions were all ipsilateral to the skin lesions. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 6 cases showed abnormal signals mainly involving white matter in 1 hemisphere, and 3 cases showed local encephalomalacia. The scattered low signal was observed in 5 cases on susceptibility weighted imaging. Localized brain parenchyma or leptomeninges enhancement was seen on Gadolinium-enhanced sequences in 5 cases. Scattered foci of calcification on the affected side were seen on cranial CT in 4 cases. Skin biopsy was performed in 2 cases. Part of the lesion of the brain was removed in 1 case, and the pathological findings suggested small vasculitis, which was consistent with skin pathological changes. All patients received symptomatic treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Oral prednisone combined with methotrexate was given in 4 cases, and 1 case was given oral prednisone only. One case was presumed to be in the resting stage of the disease due to significant cerebral atrophy in half of the brain, and only antiepileptic drugs were added. The patients were followed up for 6-36 months. The skin lesions of scleroderma and alopecia did not progress in 5 cases, and hemifacial atrophy was developed in 1 case, which was considered to be combined with Parry-Romberg syndrome. The seizures were controlled in 4 cases. One case had reduced seizure frequency but left hemiplegia. One patient still had intractable epilepsy and paroxysmal headache. 
Conclusions:
 LSCS with central nervous system involvement is more common in girls, with seizures and neurological defects as the main manifestations. Intracranial lesions are mostly ipsilateral to the skin lesions. Cerebral microbleeds, calcification, and encephalomalacia foci are common, and the pathological changes in skin and intracranial lesions are consistent with small-vessel vasculitis. Prednisone combined with methotrexate treatment has shown some efficacy, but some children remain with refractory epilepsy and neurological deficit symptoms.

[Genetics and clinical phenotypes of epilepsy associated with chromosome 2q24.3 microdeletion].
Objective:
 To summarize the genetics and clinical phenotypes of epilepsy children with 2q24.3 microdeletion. 
Methods:
 All the patients with 2q24.3 microdeletion were retrospectively collected at the Pediatric Department of Peking University First Hospital from March 2017 to July 2022. The features of clinical manifestations, electroencephalogram (EEG), and neuroimaging were analyzed. 
Results:
 There were 13 patients with 2q24.3 microdeletion were included. All 13 patients had de novo copy number variation (CNV) with a deletion size ranged 0.18-7.31 Mb. The main pathogenic genes in the region were SCN3A, SCN2A, TTC21B, SCN1A and SCN9A genes
.
 Among the 13 patients, 7 were boys, and 6 were girls. The onset age of epilepsy was 3.3(2.5, 6.0) months. Multiple seizure types were observed, including focal seizures in 13 patients, generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in 6 patients, myoclonic seizures in 3 patients, epileptic spasm in 2 patients, and tonic seizures in 2 patients. Seizures were fever sensitivity in 9 patients. Status epilepticus was observed in 6 patients. One case had normal mental motor development and 12 cases had different degrees of developmental delay. Six patients had craniofacial abnormality, 1 had six-finger deformity of the right thumb, and 1 had multiple system abnormalities. EEG showed focal discharge in 3 cases, multifocal discharges in 5 cases, multifocal and generalized discharges in 1 case. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enlargement of subarachnoid spaces in the frontal and temporal region in 4 patients, enlargement of lateral ventricle in 4 patients and delayed myelination of white matter in 1 patient. Dravet syndrome was diagnosed in 5 cases. The age at the last follow-up were 2.5(1.4,5.5) years, 1 patient was seizure free longer than 1 year, and 12 patients still had seizures. 
Conclusions:
 The epilepsy associated with 2q24.3 microdeletion is mainly induced by the deletion of SCN3A, SCN2A and SCN1A genes. The seizure onset age of 2q24.3 microdeletion related epilepsy was in infancy. Multiple seizure types are observed and the common seizure types include focal seizures and GTCS. Most patients have fever sensitivity and status epilepticus. Most patients have developmental delay. The phenotype of patients with deletion of SCN3A and SCN2A gene is more severe than that of patients with deletion of SCN1A gene only.

New insights into 
In this study, we describe the phenotype and genotype of the largest cohort of patients with Joubert syndrome (JS) carrying pathogenic variants on one of the most frequent causative genes, 
CC2D2A
.
We selected 53 patients with pathogenic variants on 
CC2D2A
, compiled and analysed their clinical, neuroimaging and genetic information and compared it to previous literature.
Developmental delay (motor and language) was nearly constant but patients had normal intellectual efficiency in 74% of cases (20/27 patients) and 68% followed mainstream schooling despite learning difficulties. Epilepsy was found in only 13% of cases. Only three patients had kidney cysts, only three had genuine retinal dystrophy and no subject had liver fibrosis or polydactyly. Brain MRIs showed typical signs of JS with rare additional features. Genotype-phenotype correlation findings demonstrate a homozygous truncating variant p.Arg950* linked to a more severe phenotype.
This study contradicts previous literature stating an association between 
CC2D2A
-related JS and ventriculomegaly. Our study implies that 
CC2D2A
-related JS is linked to positive neurodevelopmental outcome and low rate of other organ defects except for homozygous pathogenic variant p.Arg950*. This information will help modulate patient follow-up and provide families with accurate genetic counselling.

Tetanus-induced rhythmic seizures mimicking the clinical and electroencephalographic presentation of status epilepticus.
We describe the case of a woman in her 60s admitted to the intensive care unit after a first generalised tonic-clonic seizure in the context of alcohol withdrawal. She was placed under invasive mechanical ventilation due to persistence of coma despite antiepileptic treatment. Despite continuous sedation with propofol, the frequency and intensity of seizure increased. Seizures were very similar to epileptic tonic-clonic seizures and were recorded with video and electroencephalogram (EEG). A diagnosis of tetanus was considered after a scalp wound was discovered. The patient's husband revealed that a trismus had appeared a few days before hospital admission after a head trauma. EEG showed a pattern of diffuse spikes, which disappeared after a cisatracurium bolus. The diagnosis of tetanus was later confirmed by cultures from wound samples. Therefore, severe tetanus can mimic both the clinical and EEG features of status epilepticus and could be added to the differential diagnosis of epilepsy.

De novo KCNA6 variants with attenuated K
Mutations in the genes encoding neuronal ion channels are a common cause of Mendelian neurological diseases. We sought to identify novel de novo sequence variants in cases with early infantile epileptic phenotypes and neurodevelopmental anomalies.
Following clinical diagnosis, we performed whole exome sequencing of the index cases and their parents. Identified channel variants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their functional properties assessed using two-electrode voltage-clamp.
We identified novel de novo variants in KCNA6 in four unrelated individuals variably affected with neurodevelopmental disorders and seizures with onset in the first year of life. Three of the four identified mutations affect pore lining S6 α-helix of K
V
 1.6. Prominent finding of functional characterisation in Xenopus oocytes was that the channel variants showed only minor effects on channel activation but slowed channel closure and shifted the voltage dependence of deactivation in a hyperpolarizing direction. Channels with a mutation affecting the S6 helix display dominant effects on channel deactivation when co-expressed with wild-type K
V
 1.6 or K
V
 1.1 subunits.
This is the first report of de novo non-synonymous variants in KCNA6 associated with neurological or any clinical features. Channel variants showed a consistent effect on channel deactivation, slowing the rate of channel closure following normal activation. This specific gain-of-function feature is likely to underlie the neurological phenotype in our patients. Our data highlight KCNA6 as a novel channelopathy gene associated with early infantile epileptic phenotypes and neurodevelopmental anomalies.

Somatic symptom and related disorder in a large cohort of people with epilepsy: a cohort study.
To characterize somatic symptoms and related disorders (SSD) in epilepsy.
Adults with epilepsy under active follow-up at a tertiary epilepsy centre were consecutively enrolled. The diagnosis of SSD was performed by an experienced psychologist based on the structured clinical interview for DSM-5. Detailed social/demographic data, epilepsy features, psychiatric features, life quality, disability and economic burden were collected and compared between people with SSD and those without. Bodily distress syndrome checklist (BDS-checklist), Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale (SSD-12), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) were used to evaluate SSD individuals' somatic symptoms, symptom-related psychological distress, depressive and anxious symptom, respectively. Quality of life and disability was assessed by Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory 31 (QOLIE-31) and WHO Disability Assessment Schedule V.2.0 (WHO DAS 2.0). A risk prediction nomogram was generated using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis and validated.
One-hundred-and-fifty of 631 participants (24%) were diagnosed with SSD. In people with SSD, the top 3 most common somatic symptoms were memory impairment, headache and dizziness (85%, 80% and 78%, respectively), and multiple systems are involved in most (82%) people with SSD. Compared with people without SSD, those with SSD had lower QOLIE-31 total scores, higher WHO DAS 2.0 scores and disease economic burdens. LASSO analysis suggested that a history of severe traumatic brain injury, hippocampal sclerosis, low seizure worry and medication effects scores of QOLIE-31, multiple systems that somatic symptoms affected, and a high GAD-7 score were risk factors of SSD. The nomogram was validated for good accuracy in the training and testing cohorts.
SSD is likely to be common comorbidity in epilepsy and harm epilepsy prognosis. Our risk prediction nomogram was successfully developed but needs further validation in larger cohorts.

Seizure Outcome of Pediatric MR-guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy versus Open Surgery: A Matched Non-Inferiority Cohort Study.
Minimally invasive MR-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) has been proposed as an alternative to open epilepsy surgery, to address concerns regarding the risk of open surgery. Our primary hypothesis was seizure freedom one-year after MRgLITT was noninferior to open surgery in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The secondary hypothesis was MRgLITT has fewer complications and shorter hospitalization than surgery. The primary objective was to compare seizure outcome of MRgLITT to open surgery in children with DRE. The secondary objective was to compare complications and length of hospitalization of the two treatments.
This retrospective multi-center cohort study included children with DRE treated with MRgLITT or open surgery with one-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria were corpus callosotomy, neurostimulation, multilobar or hemispheric surgery and lesion with maximal dimension greater than 60 mm. MRgLITT were propensity matched to open surgery patients. The primary outcome was seizure freedom one-year post treatment. The difference in seizure freedom was compared using noninferiority test, with noninferiority margin of -10%. The secondary outcomes were complications and length of hospitalization.
185 MRgLITT patients were matched to 185 open surgery patients. Seizure freedom at one-year follow-up was observed in 89/185 (48.1%) MRgLITT and 114/185 (61.6%) open surgery patients (difference= -13.5%, one-sided 97.5%CI: -23.8% to ∞, P
Noninferiority
 =0.79). The lower confidence interval boundary of -23.8% was below the prespecified noninferiority margin of -10%. Overall complications were lower in MRgLITT compared to open surgery (10.8% vs. 29.2% respectively, p<0.001). Hospitalization was shorter for MRgLITT than open surgery (3.1±2.9 vs. 7.2±6.1 days, p<0.001).
Seizure outcome of MRgLITT one-year post treatment was inferior to open surgery. However, MRgLITT has the advantage of better safety profile and shorter hospitalization. The findings will help counsel children and parents on the benefits and risks of MRgLITT and contribute to informed decision making on treatment options.

Clinical seizure semiology is subtle and identification of seizures by parents unreliable in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex.
The objectives of this study were to assess the accuracy of parental seizure detection in infants with antenatally diagnosed tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and to document the total seizure burden (clinical and subclinical) in those patients who met criteria for prolonged EEG recording.
Consecutive infants at a single institution with antenatally diagnosed TSC who met criteria for prolonged video-EEG (vEEG) were recruited to this study. The vEEG data was reviewed and when a seizure was identified on EEG, the video and audio recording was assessed for evidence of clinical seizure and if present whether there was evidence of parent seizure identification.
Nine infants were enrolled, for whom 674 focal seizures were identified in 8/9 patients across 24 prolonged vEEG recordings, with vEEG total duration 634 hours 49 minutes (average seizure frequency of 1 focal seizure/hour). Only 220/674 (32.6%) were clinical seizures, 395/674 (58.6%) were subclinical seizures and 59/674 seizures were unable to be classified. Only 63/220 (28.6%) clinical seizures were identified by parents, with 157/220 (71.4%) not identified. Thirty clusters of epileptic spasms were detected in 1 patient. At least one clinical epileptic spasm occurred in 2/30 (6.7%) clusters, 24/30 (80%) clusters of epileptic spasms were electrographic only, and classification was uncertain for 4/30 (13.3%) clusters. No clinical epileptic spasms were detected by parents. Clinical seizure frequency was significantly under-estimated by parents in all patients.
This study demonstrates that in TSC infants meeting criteria for prolonged vEEG, that 1) parents significantly under-identify total clinical seizure count, 2) parents fail to identify epileptic spasms and 3) that seizure frequency is high. This highlights that epilepsy treatment decisions should not be solely based on parental clinical seizure identification. Prolonged vEEG monitoring may have an important role in the routine epilepsy care of TSC infants, as demonstrating undetected high clinical seizure frequency may allow improved epilepsy management decisions.

Epilepsy center characteristics and geographic region influence presurgical testing in the United States.
Persons with drug-resistant epilepsy may benefit from epilepsy surgery and should undergo presurgical testing to determine potential candidacy and appropriate intervention. Institutional expertise can influence use and availability of evaluations and epilepsy surgery candidacy. This census survey study aims to examine the influence of geographic region and other center characteristics on presurgical testing for medically intractable epilepsy.
We analyzed annual report and supplemental survey data reported in 2020 from 206 adult epilepsy center directors and 136 pediatric epilepsy center directors in the United States. Test utilization data were compiled with annual center volumes, available resources, and U.S. Census regional data. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis, and chi-square tests for univariate analysis of procedure utilization. Multivariable modeling was also performed to assign odds ratios of significant variables.
The response rate was 100% with individual element missingness less than 11% across 342 observations undergoing univariate analysis. 278 complete observations were included in the multivariable models and significant regional differences were present. For instance, compared to centers in the South, those in the Midwest used neuropsychological testing (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.2 - 6.86, p = 0.018) and FDG-PET (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.14- 6.61, p = 0.025) more commonly. For centers in the Northeast (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.93, p = 0.031) and West (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.87, p = 0.022), odds of performing SPECT was lower by nearly 50% compared to those in the South. Center accreditation level, demographics, volume and resources were also associated with varying individual testing rates.
Presurgical testing for drug resistant epilepsy is influenced by U.S. geographic region and other center characteristics. These findings have potential implications for comparing outcomes between U.S. epilepsy centers and may inject disparities in access to surgical treatment.

Adaptive behaviour in adolescents and adults with Dravet syndrome.
To explore the feasibility of using an adaptive behaviour profile (ABP) assessment generated from a well-known measure-the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II)-as an instrument for outcome measures in adolescents and adults with Dravet syndrome.
We administered the VABS-II to 35 adolescents and adults with Dravet syndrome (15 males; mean age 24 years, SD 8 years, range: 12-46 years) and collected epilepsy history and neurological features at the time of assessment. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of VABS-II raw scores and performed cluster analysis to identify different subgroups. We then explored possible relationships between clinical and epilepsy features, ABPs, and age.
Most participants obtained the minimum standard scores in the various VABS-II subdomains, while the raw score analysis outlined interindividual and intraindividual differences among skills. We found two subpopulations: one with a 'lower' ABP and one with a 'higher' ABP, corresponding respectively to individuals in whom myoclonic seizures or generalized spike-and-wave activity were present ('complete phenotype') or absent ('incomplete phenotype') on electroencephalography.
This study further delineates the natural history of Dravet syndrome. The assessment of an ABP through the VABS-II raw score analysis provides a means by which to illustrate profiles of adaptive behaviour in adolescents and adults with Dravet syndrome but shows limitations related to poor sensitivity in measuring fine clinical details. There is a need for new and more specific tools to monitor patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies.

Multidisciplinary Treatment for Severe Secondary Raynaud's Phenomenon: A Case Report.
Raynaud's phenomenon is a symptom complex manifested as intermittent fingertip ischemia caused by cold or other sympathetic drivers. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon is often more severe and could even lead to finger ulceration, making it particularly complicated to treat. We describe a case of severe Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to subclinical hypothyroidism lasting for more than 6 hours in a mid-60-year- old woman. The patient was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism, epilepsy, and secondary soft tissue infection of the right middle and ring fingers. After careful multidisciplinary consultation and discussion, the patient received vasodilation, anticoagulation, thyroxine supplementation, stellate ganglion block, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement. Finally, the female patient responded well, avoiding amputation or obviously dysfunction. Multidisciplinary team gathering the doctors from different departments may propose an appropriate strategy for patients with severe Raynaud's phenomenon and could improve the prognosis and satisfaction of patient effectively.

Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome: clinical aspects, diagnosis, and treatment.
Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency with a typical onset is a genetic disorder associated with the SLC2A1 gene. Usually appears during the first years of life with severe developmental delay, drugresistant epilepsy, and movement disorders. Diagnosis is suspected based on clinical manifestations and a low glucose level in cerebrospinal fluid,and should be confirmed by the molecular genetic study of the SLC2A1 gene. As it is a rare disease with variable clinical expression, early diagnosis is often challenging for the healthcare team. Nevertheless, this is important because early implementation of ketogenic therapy will lead to control of the clinical manifestations and a better long-term prognosis. Here we review the glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome focusing on its clinical, biochemical, molecular, and therapeutic characteristics.

Genetic Testing to Inform Epilepsy Treatment Management From an International Study of Clinical Practice.
It is currently unknown how often and in which ways a genetic diagnosis given to a patient with epilepsy is associated with clinical management and outcomes.
To evaluate how genetic diagnoses in patients with epilepsy are associated with clinical management and outcomes.
This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients referred for multigene panel testing between March 18, 2016, and August 3, 2020, with outcomes reported between May and November 2020. The study setting included a commercial genetic testing laboratory and multicenter clinical practices. Patients with epilepsy, regardless of sociodemographic features, who received a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant were included in the study. Case report forms were completed by all health care professionals.
Genetic test results.
Clinical management changes after a genetic diagnosis (ie, 1 P/LP variant in autosomal dominant and X-linked diseases; 2 P/LP variants in autosomal recessive diseases) and subsequent patient outcomes as reported by health care professionals on case report forms.
Among 418 patients, median (IQR) age at the time of testing was 4 (1-10) years, with an age range of 0 to 52 years, and 53.8% (n = 225) were female individuals. The mean (SD) time from a genetic test order to case report form completion was 595 (368) days (range, 27-1673 days). A genetic diagnosis was associated with changes in clinical management for 208 patients (49.8%) and usually (81.7% of the time) within 3 months of receiving the result. The most common clinical management changes were the addition of a new medication (78 [21.7%]), the initiation of medication (51 [14.2%]), the referral of a patient to a specialist (48 [13.4%]), vigilance for subclinical or extraneurological disease features (46 [12.8%]), and the cessation of a medication (42 [11.7%]). Among 167 patients with follow-up clinical information available (mean [SD] time, 584 [365] days), 125 (74.9%) reported positive outcomes, 108 (64.7%) reported reduction or elimination of seizures, 37 (22.2%) had decreases in the severity of other clinical signs, and 11 (6.6%) had reduced medication adverse effects. A few patients reported worsening of outcomes, including a decline in their condition (20 [12.0%]), increased seizure frequency (6 [3.6%]), and adverse medication effects (3 [1.8%]). No clinical management changes were reported for 178 patients (42.6%).
Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that genetic testing of individuals with epilepsy may be materially associated with clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes.

State-Dependent Inhibition of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels in Neuroblastoma Neuro-2A Cells by Arachidonic Acid from 
Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na
v
) are closely associated with epilepsy, cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases, and neuropathic pain. Several toxic compounds have been isolated from the marine sponge 
Halichondria okadai
; however, toxic substances that modulate Na
v
 are yet to be identified. This study aimed to identify Na
v
 inhibitors from two snake venoms and 
H. okadai
 using mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2A cells (N2A), which primarily express the specific Na
v
 subtype Na
v
1.7, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We successfully isolated arachidonic acid (AA, 
1
) from the hexane extract of 
H. okadai
, and then the fatty acid-mediated modulation of Na
v
 in N2A was investigated in detail for the first time. Octanoic acid (
2
), palmitic acid (
3
), and oleic acid (
4
) showed no inhibitory activity at 100 μM, whereas AA (
1
), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA, 
5
), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 
6
) showed IC
50
 values of 6.1 ± 2.0, 58 ± 19, and 25 ± 4.0 μM, respectively (
N
 = 4, mean ± SEM). Structure and activity relationships were investigated for the first time using two ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), EPA (
6
) and eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, 
7
), and two ω-6 PUFAs, AA (
1
) and DGLA (
5
), to determine their effects on a resting state, activated state, and inactivated state. Steady-state analysis showed that the half inactivation potential was largely hyperpolarized by 10 μM AA (
1
), while 50 μM DGLA (
5
), 50 μM EPA (
6
), and 10 μM ETA (
7
) led to a slight change. The percentages of the resting state block were 24 ± 1, 22 ± 1, 34 ± 4, and 38 ± 9% in the presence of AA (
1
), DGLA (
5
), EPA (
6
), and ETA (
7
), respectively, with EPA (
6
) and ETA (
7
) exhibiting a greater inhibition than both AA (
1
) and DGLA (
5
), and their inhibitions did not increase in the following depolarization pulses. None of the compounds exhibited the use-dependent block. The half recovery times from the inactivated state for the control, AA (
1
), DGLA (
5
), EPA (
6
), and ETA (
7
) were 7.67 ± 0.33, 34.3 ± 1.10, 15.5 ± 1.10, 10.7 ± 0.31, and 3.59 ± 0.18 ms, respectively, with AA (
1
) exhibiting a distinctively large effect. Overall, distributed binding to the resting and the inactivated states of Na
v
 would be significant for the inhibition of Na
v
, which presumably depends on the active structure of each PUFA.

Does long-term phenytoin have a place in Dravet syndrome?
Anti-seizure medications that block sodium channels are generally considered contraindicated in Dravet syndrome. There is, however, considerable debate about the sodium-channel blocker phenytoin, which is often used for status epilepticus, a frequent feature of Dravet syndrome. We describe four patients with Dravet syndrome in whom long-term phenytoin therapy reduced seizure frequency and duration. In two patients, phenytoin produced prolonged periods without status epilepticus for the first time. Attempting to wean phenytoin in all patients after 1 to 20 years of use resulted in seizure exacerbation. Reintroducing phenytoin improved seizure control, suggesting phenytoin is beneficial in some patients with Dravet syndrome.

Temporal lobe epilepsy with GAD antibodies: neurons killed by T cells not by complement membrane attack complex.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the syndromes linked to antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). It has been questioned whether 'limbic encephalitis with GAD antibodies' is a meaningful diagnostic entity. The immunopathogenesis of GAD-TLE has remained enigmatic. Improvement of immunological treatability is an urgent clinical concern. We retrospectively assessed the clinical, MRI and CSF course as well as brain tissue of 15 adult patients with GAD-TLE who underwent temporal lobe surgery. Brain tissue was studied by means of immunohistochemistry, multiplex fluorescent microscopy and transcriptomic analysis for inflammatory mediators and neuronal degeneration. In 10 patients, there was a period of mediotemporal swelling and T2 signal increase; in nine cases this occurred within the first 6 years after symptom onset. This resulted in unilateral or bilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS); three cases developed HS already within the first 2 years. All CSF studies done within the first year (n = 6) revealed intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin G. Temporal lobe surgeries were done after a median disease duration of 9 years (range 3 weeks to 60 years). Only two patients became seizure free. Brain parenchyma collected during surgery in the first 6 years revealed high numbers of plasma cells but no signs of antibody-mediated tissue damage. Even more dense was the infiltration by CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that were seen to locally proliferate. Further, a portion of these cells revealed an antigen-specific resident memory T cell phenotype. Finally, CTLs with cytotoxic granzyme B+ granules were also seen in microglial nodules and attached to neurons, suggesting a CTL-mediated destruction of these cells. With longer disease duration, the density of all lymphocytes decreased. Whole transcriptome analysis in early/active cases (but not in late/inactive stages) revealed 'T cell immunity' and 'Regulation of immune processes' as the largest overrepresented clusters. To a lesser extent, pathways associated with B cells and neuronal degeneration also showed increased representation. Surgically treated patients with GAD-TLE go through an early active inflammatory, 'encephalitic' stage (≤ 6 years) with CTL-mediated, antigen-driven neuronal loss and antibody-producing plasma cells but without signs of complement-mediated cell death. Subsequently, patients enter an apparently immunologically inactive or low-active stage with ongoing seizures, probably caused by the structural damage to the temporal lobe. 'Limbic encephalitis' with GAD antibodies should be subsumed under GAD-TLE. The early tissue-damage explains why immunotherapy does usually not lead to seizure-freedom.

The use of virtual tools in narrowing the impact of health disparities in neurology.
The concept of Epilepsy Treatment Gap (ETG) refers to the proportion of people with epilepsy who are not being appropriately treated. The ETG in the USA approaches 10%, with historically underserved populations and rural populations disproportionately affected. The ETG in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) is reported to be 5-10 times higher than in high-income countries. The growing availability of reliable internet access offers a unique opportunity to provide better care to children and adults with epilepsy. In this paper we explore various telehealth (TH) initiatives that have leveraged the availability of easy and free access to an internet connection in reducing the ETG in underserved regions of the world. We describe several interventions targeted to reach patients and providers in rural areas of the United States and in LMIC. First, we examine initiatives that were developed to improve patient access to coordinated care and education regarding epilepsy and seizures. Next, we describe an intervention designed to improve knowledge of epilepsy diagnosis and treatment for providers in LMIC. We conclude with a brief overview of the use of virtual tools in diminishing the ETG.

Antiseizure medication in early nervous system development. Ion channels and synaptic proteins as principal targets.
The main strategy for the treatment of epilepsy is the use of pharmacological agents known as antiseizure medication (ASM). These drugs control the seizure onset and improves the life expectancy and quality of life of patients. Several ASMs are contraindicated during pregnancy, due to a potential teratogen risk. For this reason, the pharmacological treatments of the pregnant Women with Epilepsy (WWE) need comprehensive analyses to reduce fetal risk during the first trimester of pregnancy. The mechanisms by which ASM are teratogens are still under study and scientists in the field, propose different hypotheses. One of them, which will be addressed in this review, corresponds to the potential alteration of ASM on ion channels and proteins involved in relevant signaling and cellular responses (i.e., migration, differentiation) during embryonic development. The actual information related to the action of ASM and its possible targets it is poorly understood. In this review, we will focus on describing the eventual presence of some ion channels and synaptic proteins of the neurotransmitter signaling pathways present during early neural development, which could potentially interacting as targets of ASM. This information leads to elucidate whether these drugs would have the ability to affect critical signaling during periods of neural development that in turn could explain the fetal malformations observed by the use of ASM during pregnancy.

Software tool for visualization of a probabilistic map of the epileptogenic zone from seizure semiologies.
Around one third of epilepsies are drug-resistant. For these patients, seizures may be reduced or cured by surgically removing the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which is the portion of the brain giving rise to seizures. If noninvasive data are not sufficiently lateralizing or localizing, the EZ may need to be localized by precise implantation of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes. The choice of iEEG targets is influenced by clinicians' experience and personal knowledge of the literature, which leads to substantial variations in implantation strategies across different epilepsy centers. The clinical diagnostic pathway for surgical planning could be supported and standardized by an objective tool to suggest EZ locations, based on the outcomes of retrospective clinical cases reported in the literature. We present an open-source software tool that presents clinicians with an intuitive and data-driven visualization to infer the location of the symptomatogenic zone, that may overlap with the EZ. The likely EZ is represented as a probabilistic map overlaid on the patient's images, given a list of seizure semiologies observed in that specific patient. We demonstrate a case study on retrospective data from a patient treated in our unit, who underwent resective epilepsy surgery and achieved 1-year seizure freedom after surgery. The resected brain structures identified as EZ location overlapped with the regions highlighted by our tool, demonstrating its potential utility.

Regulation of gut microbiome by ketogenic diet in neurodegenerative diseases: A molecular crosstalk.
The gut taxonomical profile is one of the contributory factors in maintaining homeostasis within the central nervous system (CNS). Of late, the efficacy of diet as a target of treatment, and how various dietary interventions may modulate gut microbiota differently have been an area of focus in research. The role of ketogenic diet (KD) in particular has been well-established in other diseases like intractable epilepsy due to its postulated effects on gut microbiome modulation, resulting in neuronal stability and prevention of epileptogenesis. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to critically evaluate the current available literature investigating the interplay between the three distinct entities: ketogenic diet, neurodegeneration, and gut microbiota, which may serve as a focus guide for future neurodegenerative diseases (ND) therapeutic research. A comprehensive literature search was performed on three databases; PubMed, Scopus, and Ovid Medline. A total of 12 articles were selected for critical appraisal, after subjecting to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study. The selected articles revealed that the hopes of KD as a treatment modality for ND are being ventured into as these individuals are said to acquire gut dysbiosis, primarily through increased colonization of phyla 
Proteobacteria
 and 
Firmicutes
. Although positive effects including restoration of healthy gut microbes such as 
Akkermansia Muciphilia
 sp., improvement in cognitive functioning and decline in neuro-inflammatory markers were noted, this systematic review also depicted conflicting results such as decrease in alpha and beta species diversity as well as diminution of healthy gut commensals such as 
Bifidobacteriace
. In addition, positive neuromodulation were also observed, notably an increase in cerebral blood perfusion to ventromedial hippocampal region 
via
 increased expression of eNOS and clearance of amyloid-beta proteins across the blood-brain-barrier 
via
 expression of p-glycoprotein. Neuroprotective mechanisms of ketogenic diet also included downregulation of mTOR expression, to prevention acceleration of pathological diseases such as Alzheimer's. Thus due to this conflicting/contrasting results demonstrated by ketogenic diet, such as a decline in gut species richness, diminution in beneficial microbes and decline cognition unless delivered in an intermittent fasting pattern, further studies may still be required before prior recommendation of a ketogenic diet therapeutic regime in ND patients.

A Wolf in Hiding: Epilepsy and Post-ictal Psychosis As Unrecognized Presenting Features of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems. Many patients present with neurological and psychiatric signs and symptoms at some point in the course of the disease. Here, we present a patient with neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) who presented with long-standing and difficult-to-control epileptic seizures and post-ictal psychotic symptoms prior to the diagnosis of SLE. A 39-year-old patient with a ten-year history of uncontrolled epileptic seizures despite multiple medications and recent diagnosis of chronic kidney disease presented to the emergency department following multiple witnessed seizures. Her seizures were controlled following initial interventions and the patient was admitted to the hospital to control metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Later, the patient developed psychosis with auditory hallucinations, combative behavior, and agitation which were controlled with restraints and sedatives. Initial serological and urinary studies revealed disturbances of multiple systems and triggered broad workup resulting in positive serological SLE markers. The patient was then started on immunosuppressive medications with prompt control of post-ictal psychosis. The patient was discharged with immunosuppressive regimen and control of her seizures. This case highlights that signs and symptoms of NPSLE may appear before the onset of SLE diagnosis. Additionally, our patient had long-standing epilepsy with post-ictal psychosis, which has not been reported in the literature before. We believe this case highlights the challenges in the diagnosis of NPSLE, the rapid control of seizures and/or psychosis with SLE treatment, and the necessity to broaden the differential diagnosis in atypical presentation of seizures and/or psychosis.

Changes of interictal epileptiform discharges during medication withdrawal and seizures: A scalp EEG marker of epileptogenicity.
To determine the influence of antiseizure medication (ASM) withdrawal on interictal epileptogenic discharges (IEDs) in scalp-EEG and seizure propensity.
We included 35 adult unifocal epilepsy patients admitted for presurgical evaluation in the EEG and Epilepsy Unit of Geneva between 2016 and 2020, monitored for at least 5 days. ASM was individually tapered down, and automated IED detection was performed using Epilog PreOp (Epilog NV, Belgium, Ghent). We compared spike rate per hour (SR) at day 1 when patients were on full medication (baseline) with SR at the day with the lowest dose of medication. To determine possible peri-ictal changes of SR, we compared SR 8 h before and after a seizure with the SR at the same time of the baseline day.
Our results showed a significant increase in spiking activity in the day of lowest drug load if compared to spike rate at day on full medication (p < 0.001). The total amount of spikes during 24 h correlated significantly with seizure occurrence (p < 0.0001). We also revealed significant increase in peri-ictal SR, in particular 2-4 h preceding a seizure (p = 0.05) extending up to 3 h after the seizure (p = 0.03) with a short decrease just before seizure occurrence.
Our results suggest that SR increases with medication withdrawal and particularly before and after seizures. There is a complex pattern of increase and decrease around seizure onset which explains divergent results in previous studies.
Precise spike counting at similar circadian periods for a patient could help to determine the risk of seizure occurrence in a personalized fashion.

Artifact propagation in subdural cortical electrostimulation: Characterization and modeling.
Cortical stimulation 
via
 electrocorticography (ECoG) may be an effective method for inducing artificial sensation in bi-directional brain-computer interfaces (BD-BCIs). However, strong electrical artifacts caused by electrostimulation may significantly degrade or obscure neural information. A detailed understanding of stimulation artifact propagation through relevant tissues may improve existing artifact suppression techniques or inspire the development of novel artifact mitigation strategies. Our work thus seeks to comprehensively characterize and model the propagation of artifacts in subdural ECoG stimulation. To this end, we collected and analyzed data from eloquent cortex mapping procedures of four subjects with epilepsy who were implanted with subdural ECoG electrodes. From this data, we observed that artifacts exhibited phase-locking and ratcheting characteristics in the time domain across all subjects. In the frequency domain, stimulation caused broadband power increases, as well as power bursts at the fundamental stimulation frequency and its super-harmonics. The spatial distribution of artifacts followed the potential distribution of an electric dipole with a median goodness-of-fit of 
R
 
2
 = 0.80 across all subjects and stimulation channels. Artifacts as large as ±1,100 μV appeared anywhere from 4.43 to 38.34 mm from the stimulation channel. These temporal, spectral and spatial characteristics can be utilized to improve existing artifact suppression techniques, inspire new strategies for artifact mitigation, and aid in the development of novel cortical stimulation protocols. Taken together, these findings deepen our understanding of cortical electrostimulation and provide critical design specifications for future BD-BCI systems.

Comprehensive league table of cost-utility ratios: A systematic review of cost-effectiveness evidence for health policy decisions in India.
Although a relatively recent concept for developing countries, the developed world has been using League Tables as a policy guiding tool for a comprehensive assessment of health expenditures; country-specific "League tables" can be a very useful tool for national healthcare planning and budgeting. Presented herewith is a comprehensive league table of cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) or Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) ratios derived from Health Technology Assessment (HTA) or economic evaluation studies reported from India through a systematic review.
Economic evaluations and HTAs published from January 2003 to October 2019 were searched from various databases. We only included the studies reporting common outcomes (QALY/DALY) and methodology to increase the generalizability of league table findings. To opt for a uniform criterion, a reference case approach developed by Health Technology Assessment in India (HTAIn) was used for the reporting of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. However, as, most of the articles expressed the outcome as DALY, both (QALY and DALY) were used as outcome indicators for this review.
After the initial screening of 9,823 articles, 79 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for the League table preparation. The spectrum of intervention was dominated by innovations for infectious diseases (33%), closely followed by maternal and child health (29%), and non-communicable diseases (20%). The remaining 18% of the interventions were on other groups of health issues, such as injuries, snake bites, and epilepsy. Most of the interventions (70%) reported DALY as an outcome indicator, and the rest (30%) reported QALY. Outcome and cost were discounted at the rate of 3 by 73% of the studies, at 5 by 4% of the studies, whereas 23% of the studies did not discount it. Budget impact and sensitivity analysis were reported by 18 and 73% of the studies, respectively.
The present review offers a reasonably coherent league table that reflects ICER values of a range of health conditions in India. It presents an update for decision-makers for making decisions about resource allocation.

Parvalbumin and parvalbumin chandelier interneurons in autism and other psychiatric disorders.
Parvalbumin (PV) is a calcium binding protein expressed by inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons in the cerebral cortex. By generating a fast stream of action potentials, PV+ interneurons provide a quick and stable inhibitory input to pyramidal neurons and contribute to the generation of gamma oscillations in the cortex. Their fast-firing rates, while advantageous for regulating cortical signaling, also leave them vulnerable to metabolic stress. Chandelier (Ch) cells are a type of PV+ interneuron that modulate the output of pyramidal neurons and synchronize spikes within neuron populations by directly innervating the pyramidal axon initial segment. Changes in the morphology and/or function of PV+ interneurons, mostly of Ch cells, are linked to neurological disorders. In ASD, the number of PV+ Ch cells is decreased across several cortical areas. Changes in the morphology and/or function of PV+ interneurons have also been linked to schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder. Herein, we review the role of PV and PV+ Ch cell alterations in ASD and other psychiatric disorders.

Anti-high mobility group box protein 1 monoclonal antibody downregulating P-glycoprotein as novel epilepsy therapeutics.
Epilepsy, a neurological illness, is characterized by recurrent uncontrolled seizures. There are many treatments of options that can be used as the therapy of epilepsy. However, anti-seizure medications as the primary treatment choice for epilepsy show many possible adverse effects and even pharmacoresistance to the therapy. High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) as an initiator and amplifier of the neuroinflammation is responsible for the onset and progression of epilepsy by overexpressing P-glycoprotein on the blood brain barrier. HMGB1 proteins then activate TLR4 in neurons and astrocytes, in which proinflammatory cytokines are produced. Anti-HMGB1 mAb works by blocking the HMGB1, reducing inflammatory activity in the brain that may affect epileptogenesis. Through the process, anti-HMGB1 mAb reduces the TLR4 activity and other receptors that may involve in promote signal of epilepsy such as RAGE. Several studies have shown that anti-HMGB1 has the potential to inhibit the increase in serum HMGB1 in plasma and brain tissue. Further research is needed to identify the mechanism of the inhibiting of overexpression of P-glycoprotein through anti-HMGB1 mAb.

Carbon dioxide tolerability and toxicity in rat and man: A translational study.
Background:
 Due the increasing need for storage of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) more individuals are prone to be exposed to high concentrations of CO
2
 accidentally released into atmosphere, with deleterious consequences. 
Methods:
 We tested the effect of increasing CO
2
 concentrations in humans (6-12%) and rats (10-50%) at varying inhalation times (10-60 min). In humans, a continuous positive airway pressure helmet was used to deliver the gas mixture to the participants. Unrestrained rats were exposed to CO
2
 in a transparent chamber. In both species regular arterial blood gas samples were obtained. After the studies, the lungs of the animals were examined for macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities. 
Results:
 In humans, CO
2
 concentrations of 9% inhaled for >10 min, and higher concentrations inhaled for <10 min were poorly or not tolerated due to exhaustion, anxiety, dissociation or acidosis (pH < 7.2), despite intact oxygenation. In rats, concentrations of 30% and higher were associated with CO
2
 narcosis, epilepsy, poor oxygenation and, at 50% CO
2
, spontaneous death. Lung hemorrhage and edema were observed in the rats at inhaled concentrations of 30% and higher. 
Conclusion:
 This study provides essential insight into the occurrence of physiological changes in humans and fatalities in rats after acute exposure to high levels of CO
2
. Humans tolerate 9% CO
2
 and retain their ability to function coherently for up to 10 min. These data support reconsideration of the current CO
2
 levels (<7.5%) that pose a risk to exposed individuals (<7.5%) as determined by governmental agencies to ≤9%.

Predictive functional, statistical and structural analysis of 
Okur-Chung Neurodevelopmental Syndrome (OCNDS) and Poirier-Bienvenu Neurodevelopmental Syndrome (POBINDS) were recently identified as rare neurodevelopmental disorders. OCNDS and POBINDS are associated with heterozygous mutations in the 
CSNK2A1
 and 
CSNK2B
 genes which encode CK2α, a serine/threonine protein kinase, and CK2β, a regulatory protein, respectively, which together can form a tetrameric enzyme called protein kinase CK2. A challenge in OCNDS and POBINDS is to understand the genetic basis of these diseases and the effect of the various CK2⍺ and CK2β mutations. In this study we have collected all variants available to date in 
CSNK2A1
 and 
CSNK2B
, and identified hotspots. We have investigated CK2⍺ and CK2β missense mutations through prediction programs which consider the evolutionary conservation, functionality and structure or these two proteins, compared these results with published experimental data on CK2α and CK2β mutants, and suggested prediction programs that could help predict changes in functionality of CK2α mutants. We also investigated the potential effect of CK2α and CK2β mutations on the 3D structure of the proteins and in their binding to each other. These results indicate that there are functional and structural consequences of mutation of CK2α and CK2β, and provide a rationale for further study of OCNDS and POBINDS-associated mutations. These data contribute to understanding the genetic and functional basis of these diseases, which is needed to identify their underlying mechanisms.

Five patients with spinal muscular atrophy-progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME): a novel pathogenic variant, treatment and review of the literature.
Spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disease due to bi-allelic mutations in the ASAH1 gene. SMA-PME is characterized by progressive muscle weakness from three to seven years of age, accompanied by epilepsy, intractable seizures, and sometimes sensorineural hearing loss. To the best of our knowledge, 47 cases have been reported. The present study reports five patients from four different families affected by SMA-PME characterized by progressive myoclonic epilepsy, proximal weakness, and lower motor neuron disease, as proven by electrodiagnostic studies. Genetic analysis identified two different mutations in the ASAH1 (NM_177924.4) gene, a previously reported pathogenic variant, c.125C>T (p.Thr42Met), and a novel likely pathogenic variant c.109C>A (p.Pro37Thr). In addition to reporting a novel pathogenic variant in the ASAH1 gene causing SMA-PME disease, this study compares the signs, phenotypic, and genetic findings of the case series with previous reports and discusses some symptomatic treatments.
